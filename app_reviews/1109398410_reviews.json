      "title": "Charged wrongly",
      "text": "I recently used the Porter app to send a truck for delivery in Dubai. While the service itself was convenient, the payment experience was frustrating. I paid the driver 150 AED in cash as agreed, but later, the app kept asking me for a separate payment through the app. Despite providing proof of payment to the driver, the support team kept insisting on additional payment.\n\nThis kind of confusion and lack of communication between the app and its drivers is disappointing. Until they improve their payment system and customer support, I‚Äôd recommend being cautious when using this service.",

I scrambled to make the move that same day and was assigned a Porter with an open truck on a rain day. I asked to cancel the whole thing and was instead randomly assigned a third partner who is a no show. I‚Äôm appalled at the lack of disclosure (open trucks) and inability to Porter to keep their end of the bargain. The porters seem a law unto themselves, the third one went silent after calling to fix up a time with me.",

Again today I just opened the app and I was checking the pricing again I was getting continuous calls even though I asked them to not call me multiple times. Whats the point of having an app when you are running a call centre like service. And how come you are getting the information about what activity I am doing on app. Its so inconvenient and unsafe. I just deleted the app today.",

      "text": "We booked Dolly several months in advance to help move items for our wedding. Although movers had been assigned well in advance, on the day of our wedding, we opened the app only to discover that they were no longer assigned, leaving us without anyone to assist with our move. Dolly never communicated this to us, leaving us completely in the dark even on the day of the event. When we contacted customer service, they informed us that while drivers may have been messaging us, no one was officially assigned. They blamed an automated system and claimed there was nothing they could do. Their “solution” was to suggest moving our scheduled time back a few hours, hoping it might get assigned. This made no sense—why would a few hours change anything after months of inaction? We explained that this was for our wedding and rescheduling wasn’t an option, but they offered no other alternatives. As a result, we spent the morning of our wedding frantically searching for other movers to transport our decor. It was an incredibly stressful experience and completely avoidable. Dolly’s service was absolutely unacceptable and added unnecessary chaos to what should have been a joyful day.",

I then submitted a Help request as my info appeared lost and got a phone call from someone in India. She had to retake my entire request over the phone —however submitted it incorrectly and put the wrong address and wrong time in the request. (I wanted the driver at 9:30 in the morning. I got a message at 6:30 in the morning that they were on their way almost there, and the business wasn’t open.) I could not reach anyone to talk to and the chat did not work at all. Additionally, the farmed out helpdesk in India (I believe) had rude personnel. I would not recommend this app until they clean things up. The only way I was able to reach someone was through an anonymous text message I got at 6:30 in the morning … I called that number.  \nFortunately, they answered. The driver was awesome/very nice crew and I felt sorry for them.",

Additionally the driver told them his truck broke down sooooo then he lied to me or both of us about why he was late. Once they arrived they moved quickly and we're polite.

      "text": "A horrible experience. When the first helper arrived, he informed us that he had not heard from the second helper after trying to reach him all day. He suggested we contact Dolly support to either cancel the move or see if they could send someone else. I attempted to call Dolly support 3 times without being able to speak with a human and opted in for a callback which was never received. Eventually we learned that the second helper was “30 minutes away” which turned into 90 minutes. My move was very time sensitive so myself and my injured family member were pressured into helping move items down the three flights of winding stairs which is why I hired moving help in the first place. Canceling this move was not an option. Because we could not move the large items without the second helper we spent over an hour just moving boxes closer to the truck which would then be moved into the truck later. The mover asked my family member to help him move a couch, knowing my family member had a back injury. When the second helper arrived almost two hours late, he was often on his phone and inexplicably left at one point for 15 minutes to move his car when my street had free parking. I hired a different moving company to unload, and when they opened the truck they were baffled at how poorly and inefficiently it was loaded. At least a dozen of my items were damaged, including an expensive coffee table I need to replace. When I did finally reach customer support, I did not have the option of speaking to a representative by phone but had to email. They informed me they do not cover damage to items for labor only blocks, so beware you could accrue hundreds or thousands of dollars in damage and Dolly doesn’t care. The second moving company recommended I ask for a refund based on how poorly this job was done and said if they had done this poorly they would offer a refund. Nick who I was emailing with from support was very unhelpful and unconcerned by how poor my entire experience went, and didn’t even acknowledge that my injured family member was asked to help move a couch by Dolly after we informed then he had a back injury. They also did not issue a refund and took days to get back to me after my first attempt at contacting them. Please stay far away from this company.",

On top of it, they had to take it back to the store because it would not fit. They put holes in the walls, ceiling, hit the corners so bad the metal corner bead was exposed in several locations. Now here is the best part, the guy is oh let me take pics for insurance purposes lol, Dolly will cover $300 no matter how much damage these helpers do as they consider them contractors and are not liable for anything they do, got to love ! Now, we just moved into this brand new townhouse with $1900 worth of damage and they will only cover $300. Here is the kicker, on that day after the guys left to return the sectional to the store I get a call from Dolly wanting to charge me a additional $50 for them taking it back ( yeah I don’t think so ) and they charged me the full $203 for the service which is just crazy to me. So, $203 for service $1900 worth of damage and you will give $300 for it, so basically I got $100 towards the damage is the way I look at this. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE !!! YOU HAVE BEEN WORNED !!!",

      "text": "Just had an absolutely awful experience with Dolly. I scheduled movers through Dolly 5 weeks in advance. They canceled on me 2 hours before my scheduled move time. Dolly didn’t notify me, email or text to let me know my movers had canceled. It was a truly awful experience & I ended up having to spend way more on task rabbit for same day moving help and do most of the move myself. Dolly offered no financial compensation for all the last minute expenses I had to incur because their movers decided to cancel last minute. All the customer service person would say was “well the movers had to pay a cancellation fee to Dolly!” Well good for Dolly I’m so relieved to hear you are profiting off leaving me in the lurch!!!\n\n Moving is not the same as calling an Uber for a ride somewhere, Dolly should be prepared to help customers in this situation because there is no flexibility with lease end dates. This gig economy business model Dolly has created for moving clearly does not work. I will never use Dolly again.",

They canceled my trip not I. And the app charged me 520 dollars than because the crew said they weren’t getting paid I payed them again 250. Plus I had to hire three additional workers at a cost of 150 dollars because the criminals barely showed up with a dolly 1/2 the size of my own. So where am I at. It cost me 1000 dollars today to move an item roughly the same size as a refrigerator. I have asked to be refunded 520 dollars and was told no. This is a scam and 1000 dollars was stolen from me. They did deliver it but refused to even put it up right so I’ve had to do alone which I was able to do because I’m not an idiot.

Let’s start off with that when the helper got there he thought was moving stuff from upstairs to downstairs. Granted we gave them two addresses so not sure where the stupidity started. So then the other shows up thirty minutes late. They was supposed to bring truck but guess they thought since was a woman they could try and weasel their way out. Well joke on them cause I didn’t return the uhaul van yet. So then they had no choice but to continue job. I was at work and my sister was there. She recorded all and audio as well. They talked so much that they literally almost ran my headboard into the living room wall. They damaged the old property wall, they didn’t even load up everything. Mind you I paid for two hours and got work of one hour and ten minutes. So moving on to the other house. They was refusing to unload everything and threaten to take off with stuff. My sister got this all on recording till I told her to tell them Newark police who I know some officers can be called. All of sudden they started to unload. They damaged my dressers, my tv stand and footboard. The way he spoke to my sister and the damage he did you are better off picking someone off the internet who never has done this before. Those other reviews must be bogus. The google reviews I wish I had found first cause they are spot on. Stay away from this company unless you don’t care to spend money and have your stuff damaged.",

We had to call him after he was an over a hour late.  He arrived not dressed to move furniture in a dinner jacket and dress shoes.  The additional helper that we paid for  was not with him.  The store employees had to load the item which was very heavy.  Which I had provided a picture and stated that it was very heavy when I scheduled the pick up.  He also arrived with no equipment to move or secure anything.  He did not secure the item in his truck and once he arrived was unable to get it into the house.  Overall, a horrible experience and he charged extra to take the item off of his truck.  Long and short of my story, after paying almost paying $200 the item did not end up in the house and could have been damaged.  I would have been better renting a truck and having the workers load the item, which they did anyway.",

One dropped a box of dishes. Same one had stacked way too many boxes on the trolley that were about to fall off when he went up a ramp, so I had to run over to tell him to stop and unload some of them. When I politely asked them to be more careful, they escalated it into an argument. They were constantly complaining and unprofessional. I paid and tipped them and tried to call it a day. However, it’s been two years and to this day I still feel upset over the experience. If you value your personal items, some of which are irreplaceable, hire an actual professional moving company than go through this app",

Don’t worry”. After she said that multiple times, I asked her if it was a guarantee and she switched up and said “oh unfortunately it’s not a guarantee. But if that happens you can call us that day for a refund.” So - there was a reason to worry and a refund wasn’t going to help me move in time. My move out day comes, and still no one was assigned. I ended up having to come out of pocket and rent a moving truck and pay random people I found online to help me move. It wasn’t until the end of the day on my scheduled move that a customer service agent called me to tell me “unfortunately we weren’t able to find anyone to move you today” ….obviously. I looked up Dolly on Yelp and they have multiple accounts on Yelp for different cities - all under 2-star reviews.

      "text": "I have to be honest here, I am fighting an eviction process, I have a good case for a appeal, not being served correctly. \n\nI also have all of the rent owed stashed away in escrow because it was a bad error on their behalf, not a lack of funds. So after I was thrown out of my apartment, I had to leave all of my stuff in there, and I am now homeless. Today was the day that I got access to my stuff one last time. My grandmother came through and offered me some of what little money she had left in order for me to hire movers to help me out with the furniture I had left. We are not given a ton of time to accomplish this and after some back and forth between attorneys, I had just today to do it. \n\nI have AIDS, so I am not really strong enough to do this kind of work, and I literally risk dying to do it. Hiring Dolly, I don’t have any choice but to trust that they are competitive. I requested the Dolly help hours before I needed it, but nobody accepted it. I pushed it back as far as I could go, and I got a call from someone who wanted me to pay more money when they arrived, to come and help. I didn’t have any money to spare, so he didn’t accept. He offered to do it for the amount I paid in cash, if I cancelled it - but I knew that I would not be refunded for the service in time. I understand why he would do that but it felt like a bait and switch. \n\nNobody accepted, and I was stranded. I lost everything I owned, because I know that the attorney will not accept my request to come back. I am so distraught about this. If I had the strength to do it myself I would. Maybe they don’t pay the people enough. I don’t know. \n\nIt’s not Dolly’s fault that I lost everything, but I am incredibly disappointed in how badly the expectations are set in the app, how they take $600 dollars out of your pocket to “hold” your reservation with no guarantee that your going to be able to get help. And if you are limited on resources, your money is held up by the hold on your card and you can’t even pivot to something else. \n\nI have had only positive experiences with the competition - “Lugg,” so I am sad that I trusted Dolly this time. I liked the flat rate fee, even though it was higher than Lugg, but it made no difference because I was burned. Beware, you do not want to use them for big moves. Use Lugg instead. I don’t have the choice anymore.",

However, the app did not tell me it was canceled. So I waited all day until I decided to call customer service. When I called customer service, they told me that there was a fraud alert on my account. Therefore the order was canceled, but as I stated earlier, that cancellation was not noted in the app. when I asked to clear up the fraud situation, they said they could open a ticket and that the team responsible for clearing that up would be in contact with me. When I asked if that would be done today, they could not tell me or confirm that my order would be fulfilled in time. So I tried to cancel the order via the app and oddly enough, the app told me that it was in a “incorrect state”. I suspect that means that the system was flagging it is canceled, but the app wasn’t showing it as such. Overall, this was a bad user interface experience and an even worse customer service experience. I wasted four hours waiting on my order to be fulfilled. I used Lugg instead and got a response within minutes. It was my first time using Lugg also.",

If you have issues during the service you cannot get anyone on their support line, you can only leave messages. You have to email. I emailed the company and was told the service and charges would be cancelled. When the charges posted to my account, I contacted the company again and was told it was cancelled on their end and I would need to contact my bank if it’s showing a card. They then sent in fraudulent information to make bank saying the service was complete and that I never contacted customer service. They only sent part of the text conversation I had with the helper and cut off the part where I told him I was cancelling the service. When I went back to the app the whole thread was deleted.

      "text": "In theory, this service should have been great, but next time I’ll be renting a U-haul and doing it myself.\n\nI hired a team of 2 Dolly movers to move a bed from Facebook Marketplace. The sellers disassembled the bed to help me “save money” with Dolly, so it was all ready to go when the movers arrived. Dolly added an extra $15 during the move because there was a flight of stairs at the seller’s house (even though the pieces were all disassembled, so the movers weren’t actually carrying any heavy objects down the stairs..)\n\nNo furniture pads were used, and they kept hitting the pieces on doors because they didn’t bring door stops. Normal, experienced movers always have furniture pads and door stops. One of the pieces got a nice big scratch in it.\n\nThis wonderful service cost me a cool $278. SO not worth it. Next time, I’ll be renting a U-haul.\n\nAdditionally, their app needs a lot of work. It won’t let you do anything else in the app until you answer their prompts, so I couldn’t do things like update my payment method or call customer service until I approved the $15 up  charge for the stairs.

      "text": "I used moving help only and the helpers were very nice. The main helper showed up just coming from the lake and was not happy to be working, but carried on anyway and was very nice. He was not dressed appropriately as he was in sandals and lake clothes. I thought everything went well as everything was being loaded into some U-Haul U-Boxes to be stored for a couple months. Come to find out when they were unloaded that there was damage to some of my belongings, not due to being transported to and from the U-Haul storage facility but due to the way they were handled by the moving helpers. As I was removing items I saw how things were placed in the U-Boxes and it was obvious to me there was no care taken in how my items were placed. Big example is that a 2 recliner couch was placed on top of my washing machine and the washing machine was broken due to the weight of the couch. I was furious and submitted a claim right away. After providing damage photos and even a photo of the one helper that was obviously still in lake mode the claim was denied due to liability coverage doesn’t apply to labor only moving help. I work in disputes and even my manager would have given an exception to that liability policy due to the circumstances. Just amazing how this company operates. It’s okay to have an employee who shows up to a job in lakeside clothing and shoes and destroy clients items and just wash their hands of it. I did look in my storage containers before I locked them to make sure everything was okay, but as my items were packed I wasn’t able to see certain things and missed the biggest problem that my couch was sitting onto my washer. I would never recommend this company to even my worst enemy.",

Before I was matched with a helper, someone named Daniel V. messaged me and just said “hi” with no further instructions. I was then matched with another helper, who I corresponded with but who had to cancel because he needed to pick up his kids. I was later paired with Daniel V., who I messaged with up until my move date and let him know I got a parking permit for his truck. The next day, when the movers were 30 minutes late, I called and messaged, and Daniel responded that he could not do the job unless Dolly adjusted his payout. I later learned that Dolly adjusted payouts for helpers because it was a busy time in my city, but I guess this helper wasn’t getting that. However, instead of contacting Dolly, he did not answer their calls or mine, and he did not cancel the job, which meant I couldn’t be matched with a new helper. PLUS Dolly support insisted that it was my fault that he didn’t show up because I had selected the wrong size vehicle. I had scheduled a pick up truck because I only had 3 larger items (not even a couch) and was only moving 2 blocks away. I was stranded on my moving day because this is a poorly run company that does not pay their helpers fairly, and the helpers are trying to get as many jobs as they can (understandably) and don’t have time to follow up with customers because they’re busy doing other jobs. They also have horrible BBB reviews. Take your money elsewhere.",

It’s very frustrating and there’s usually no fixing once something goes wrong. And if there is a solution, it happens days later giving the opportunity for the customer to cancel or just flat out wasting their time. If you have something small, go for it; but if it’s any big item, I’d say stay far away from dolly.

John, our “helper” today was friendly, polite, quick so I was happy to tip him.  The one thing I would have liked is a “confirm” call the day before and/or day of the delivery.  I spent sometime trying to track down the delivery.  It would have been nice to have a phone number to call Dolly or the helper directly.  The people at the Container Store were helpful and knowledgeable (Laura) and the people at TCS Installation (Penmarc) also were concerned and helpful.",

One of them showed up on time ready to work, the other one was about 45 minutes to an hour late and it just took an hour and a half total. My truck looked like they just threw my things in it, my leather chair was ripped, my new desk had black marks on the top that won’t come off, my relatively new couch, which was in excellent condition, is now torn in several spots and has black stains. I’m going to have to make another trip (5 hours away) to get the rest of my things because they didn’t load it properly and make it fit right. I used Dolly once before and the head helper was very good, made everything fit perfectly. I got the same size truck so it should’ve definitely fit! Since the assistant helper was so late, the head helper could only do so much, which I think played a big role in why my stuff was simply tossed in wherever. I’m beyond upset about this and I firmly believe I deserve at least a partial refund. I will NOT be using Dolly again!",

I had called the company and asked about this, they said the supplies were included in the package. I’m also pretty confident one of them stole my marijuana as well. The move was quick though.",

      "text": "Worst moving experience of my life! I DO NOT RECOMMEND this company! I am a single mother with a young child. The movers were 1) Late! and 2) LEFT A KING-SIZED HEADBOARD LOOSELY DANGLING FROM MY STAIRWELL!!! The claims group first said they would only reimburse approximately $400 for the bed and $500 for environmental damages. They wanted estimates which I obtained. The estimates to repair the damage to my floors, walls, ceiling and head board totaled over $9,000. Dolly then came back and said they would only reimburse $500 total for the damages despite additional insurance coverage I paid for. I paid $375 to move ONE bed and they caused thousands of dollars of damage to my property. \n\nThe movers refused to take the headboard over an outside railing to get it to a 2nd floor bedroom. Instead they insisted upon taking it up a rounded interior hallway that is too narrow. After they got the headboard STUCK they said they were too tired to try to move it anymore and had to leave it because they were late for another job! \n\nI had to PAY FULL PRICE FOR A SECOND MOVE IN ORDER TO GET THE HEADBOARD OUT OF MY STAIRWELL! The second movers came in the evening and didn’t want to assemble the bed even though it was clearly stated in the purchase order. \n\nThey said they were too tired and would have to come back the following day to assemble the bed. The next day, they couldn’t assemble the bed using basic nuts, washers, and bolts. They tried to steal the washers to cover up their errors. As I was questioning where the washers went and looking diligently on the floor, one of the movers dropped a washer from his pocket, as though I didn’t notice, and claimed it had been there the whole time. Then, the second movers WOULD NOT LEAVE MY HOME WITHOUT PAYMENT FOR TIP!! I paid an additional $60 to get them to leave without further damaging my property or harming me.",

I have never had a worse moving experience or a worse experience with the company after the fact.\n \nI cannot stress enough that EVERY SINGLE box I opened had broken items in it, the movers broke my bed, snapping the metal supports in half and they broke my window AC unit by causing a GIANT dent in the frame, so deep that the internal fan hits it when you turn the AC on. The movers were rude, inappropriate and took literally 0 care with my stuff.\n \nI live in NYC and was moving to another part of the city, not too far away. My old apartment was up two flights of stairs and the second was one flight of stairs. Just want to put into perspective that this was not a difficult move, I was not going very far and the movers/helpers did not have to go up 5 flights of stairs. \n \nIts no exaggeration that every single box I opened had broken items in it. I’ve done big moves, from FL to NYC, NYC to DC, DC to NYC and within NYC. I’ve moved myself, hired other movers and had friends help in the past. I have NEVER had a worse moving experience, and I moved right after a blizzard before (trust me, I had no choice and it was awful). NEVER in my life, have I seen so many broken items, never. \n \nEvery box I opened had more and more broken stuff in there. I don’t mean chips, or a scuff, I mean hard metal items totally damaged, with metal pieces concaved in on themselves, glasses broken, standing fans totally broken, even my bookcase, that had a metal frame and is mountable to the wall is broken. The metal is so far bent that it cannot even stand up straight and no amount of effort seems to help get it back in alignment. \n \nAll of this is upsetting on its own, then comes my experience after the fact. I paid for extra insurance “just in case” – so I was covered up to $2,500 for related damages. The total amount of damages was well over $3,000. Dolly, after weeks of back and forth, me sending pictures of all the damage, receipts showing the cost of the items and providing an itemized list of the damaged items, along with their prices, Dolly finally tells me how much they’re prepared to offer me. $291. \n \nLet me say that again, Dolly offered me $291, less than 10% of the actual value of the total value for items like my bed, where the frame was literally broken in half and AC unit, which was so damaged that the internal fan scrapes against the exterior metal frame were not covered because they were considered  to be  \"regular moving wear and tear such as minor dents, stains or scratches.\"\n \nI am in the process of trying to get more money through my insurance claim, but I’m on day 2 of no response from Dolly. Do yourself the ultimate favor and never use this moving company. I understand that not all moves will be like this and other movers may be better, but in case something does go wrong, like what happened with me, Dolly will do absolutely nothing to help you.",

The movers were argumentative and insulting. And also incompetent. Additionally they kept saying they were only getting $20 for this move and I was paying $200- so they get a very small cut of the fee and are not interested in doing a good job.",

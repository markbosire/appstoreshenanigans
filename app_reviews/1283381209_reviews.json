      "text": "The platform's tech and user-friendly interface makes scheduling deliveries so convenient. \n\nOne of the standout features of FRAYT is its range of vehicle options, so they cater to various shipment sizes and requirements. They are able to match you with the best suited vehicle and professional local driver to handle deliveries.\n\nThe flexibility of delivery options, including on-demand, same day, and scheduled deliveries, align perfectly with dynamic business operations.\n\nThe real-time tracking feature provides end-to-end visibility, allowing us to promptly monitor deliveries. \n\nI highly recommend FRAYT to any business looking for a reliable delivery solution.",

      "text": "1) Unclarified changes in policy- no longer do personal/home furniture deliveries however still allows you to schedule and input your payment information.\n2) Change in policy to one driver - Means any desk, lobby furniture, or other large items will not be delivered (unless you or an employee is sent to meet the driver and help load but even then they may not deliver).\n3) Poor customer service - Unhelpful in solving problems, do not listen to suggestions or offer apologies for the inconvenience.\n4) False charges advertising - Was shown service charges would be $39.99 + tax. However was charged $59.98\nMAIN TAKEAWAY: Overall horrible company which should be reported to the BBB. DO NOT HIRE! You will be better off through a different company even if charged a bit more.",

The problem is that Stripe has a pop up that interferes with selecting a match for a driving job. Itâ€™s impossible to use the app, even though Iâ€™ve already signed up with Stripe. Iâ€™m really at a loss and vulnerable at this point. Until someone from the company reaches out to me to solve this problem, I cannot recommend that anyone seeking a driving job use this app.",

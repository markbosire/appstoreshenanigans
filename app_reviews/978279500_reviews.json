      "text": "Dallas/Fort Worth area courier.\nI would like to tell abit about my personal experience with the GoShare. When I registered there was no orders almost ever, that was especially said because I had to pay $150 for my background check(you have to pay for BC but not everybody pays $150 only those who ever lived in NY). So it’s not a reliable income not even supplement. 2-3 months later business picked up a little, there is one company that sends orders ones a day on the first come first served basis. So I got my first order but when I arrived and waited in line for about 30 min(the whole thing took about an hour) the guy in charge said he doesn’t have my order in the system. Also you are independent contractor so no body will compensate you for time, gas, etc. To summarize \n1. Not enough orders and compensation is not grate to say the least \n2. Long wait time at the pick up location plus you might not even get your order.\n3. Lack of item description usually it’s something like 1-gag mag dag 3pc 46?)8’frtu, that’s your description, I just never know if it is going to fit in my car:)\n3. People at the pick up are poorly organized, to them you just a nuisance.\n4. Orders usually have to be picked up at certain time which means you have to be close which means more unpaid time waiting in the area.\n5. GoShare is not transparent about earnings in specific areas\nBig plus to GoShare support team, they respond really fast. \nI wouldn’t recommend unless you are traveling the same way as the package and you can allocate the time, again this is courier experience(cars/small cars).",

Customer service is very responsive and very helpful. Payments have been quick and estimated job payments have been accurate.  The only challenge is beating out the competition for jobs, since it’s first-come, first-serve. Got to be quick, responding to notifications!  What an excellent system too!  Using a smart phone, an app, and my truck to make money.  My Apple Watch is also a very useful part of the technology.

      "text": "To all my fellow drivers, beware of this goshare app…they take your credit card info for checking background 43$. They make you acknowledge accept many things..first drivers can not be late for pickup if it’s more than 15minutes late and if the customer complain they keep track of it, after you make $$in thousands few months later they would take money from your credit card without your authorization because you already authorized them on the credit card before. I think only thieves would do that. They have only ladies handling the accounting department and those ladies have no mercy they are rude, they don’t talk to you…they charge your credit card for penalty for showing up and e-mail you the receipt for the amount took. If the driver cancel the pickup for some reason and becomes more than their limit they charge you penalty and take money …they have only chat window sometimes nobody would respond for hours…no one will talk to you one on one when you are in need, if they need to talk to you they will and they expect you to answer the phone., that is slavery. Basically they treat drivers like trash. Sometimes they have long haul deliveries for solar companies, they pay only one way tolls and they don’t pay tolls for you coming home if it’s longer than 8hr drive they don’t pay for hotel stay, they expect you drive back immediately or don’t care if you drive immediately….that makes 16hrs of driving which is not allowed. All other apps like this give Deadhead ($ per mile) to comeback home after drop off. This GoShare doesn’t give you a penny not even tolls to come back…instead they take money from your credit card without your authorization….be careful of this scams.",

The orders are so sparse, I can’t make any plan or schedule and the few orders I do get are so far away from my starting point, I lose money in time and fuel just getting to the pickup location. If you accept a helper job and there’s no main driver, they will reschedule the pickup for a different time, even though you just spent an hour driving to the location.

Beyond that though..\n\n- I’m not wasting time and money getting my brand new vehicle inspected. \n- I’m not spending $45 (or $150 if you’ve ever lived in NY for some reason) for you to do a background check. That’s a cost of doing business that should fall on the company, definitely not the contractor. No other app or company has ever asked me to pay for a background fee. \n- They charge a cancellation fee to drivers ranging from $10-50. How ridiculous. Their video tries to explain how it is not a punishment but there’s no going around it. Your parent/spouse/child suddenly in the hospital? Pay up. You get in a car accident? Pay up. \n- To move on with the onboarding process you half to watch a HALF HOUR LONG video that explains nothing but common sense, and about 7 minutes explaining the clumsy flow of this app. AND THEN you have to answer a 41, forty one, question quiz on the video. It’s easier to sign up to deliver people (which doesn’t say anything good about uber or Lyft either 😂)\n\nThere’s better apps and services to use. I will not be recommending this company to customers or other gig economists.",

Nothing works, went back to the online chat, were the second person told me there was never a chat in the first place. Long story short ended up like the first time. Applying process is super annoying, no support at all. I’m very disappointed in this app. Tried to download the app multiple times nothing has changed.

Now I can work out whenever I want to. there are so many different workouts to choose from. Even after years of using the app I am finally exploring all the options. My only beef with the app is that the user needs to be able to organize favorites in some usable way: type of workout, by time of work workout, etc. with my comments attached.",

Second, before the upgrade I could cast the video from my phone to a tv and see the video on both screens. This is very helpful so that my phone can be on the floor when I’m there for the workout. Now, the phone is blank. I contacted support and they said tough luck—it’s just the way the new app is designed.

      "text": "I’ve been kickboxing and lifting weights at home for 20 years, and discovering MOSSA Fight on Xbox a few years ago truly brought me to a new level of badassery and fun. When Xbox got rid of it I was at a loss, so I got in touch with MOSSA and they released the workouts via DVD first, then streaming. These workouts use the BEST music you will find. The workouts truly use the music - for example, with a punch or kick you might hear breaking glass. Or during weight lifting, they will time each lift to the beat but the beat is varied, like: 1,2,3 (pause) 4! (Repeat). Believe me you will want to turn up the volume and the time will fly! After 20 years it was great to learn some new MMA moves too, several actually. I also enjoy their Centergy series, it’s a mash up of yoga and Pilates, great balance work too. There is something for everyone: dance, yoga, weights, step, bike, HIIT, etc. They have 10 minute workouts that you can combine to get a variety, or just do when short on time. Most workouts are 30 minutes so you could do two different ones. And recently they’ve added 60 minute workouts. I’ve been streaming this for a few years, since they started it and each year we got new additions. The app always works for me via my Apple TV without issues unlike my other fitness program. I’ve never left an app review before but I figured it’s time for me to show my appreciation to MOSSA and try to spread the word. Amazing music, trainers and workouts.",

These 30-minute, cutting edge programs are packed with energy, awesome soundtracks and the world’s BEST instructors! \n\nThe 30-minute formats are a great compliment to the 60-minute MOSSA programs offered in elite clubs world-wide. It is nice that they are not simply a ‘club class’ watered down to a half hour. They have different moves and a totally different training effect.\n\nThank you MOSSA for your continued push to make exercise more innovative, fun and accessible to all.\n\nPS: for those who haven’t tried a ‘live’ class at a club, find a gym in your area that offers these amazing, results-driven programs!\n\n~Peggy Gregor",

We hung up the call, I sent him a text and advised that I could cancel the trip and schedule a different driver. He then calls me to start arguing with me and told me to do whatever I wanted and playing the blame game with me regarding the wrong address. I already accepted fault and apologized. Overall, very unprofessional. I messaged the people of customer service and they basically told me the driver is not obligated to drive if I sent the wrong address.

As the seller was moving, I needed to secure delivery quickly.  \n\nI found GoShare online. Its like Uber for deliveries.  \n\nUsing the app, i entered the pick up and delivery locations, details and a photo of the furniture. A driver picked up the job in less than 5 minutes. \n\nI received a text notification from GoShare letting me know the project had been assigned.  I had a few more details to relay. Jason replied quickly letting me know the information would be relayed to the driver. I was impressed that a real person handled the information.  \n\nThe delivery was successful. The driver communicated all steps of the project and delivered the furniture safely. \n\nUpon delivery, drivers mark the end of the project, and take a photo of the delivered item. This is saved in the app for your records.  \n\nThe app is easy to use, indicates progress, handles payment and tips efficiently.  Users can see an itemized break down of the final charges before paying.  \n\nThere is a charge if the delivery takes longer than expected.  My project did take longer as the driver encountered traffic. \n\nI was happy with my GoShare experience and will use the service again!",

Customer service was available and responded quickly. Inspite of the above hassle I still would give a 5 star rating.",

      "text": "I wanted to share my experience and disappointment with this app. I placed a request a week in advance to move a treadmill. The request was for a pickup and helper. When the driver showed up to the address he stated the treadmill will need to be taken apart. I asked where the helper was and he said he is running late. The helper arrived an hour late. I helped the driver with the disassembly. Once apart I helped the driver with moving the pieces to his truck. Just to point out, I’m still recovering from major ankle surgery. The helper arrived when the last piece was being moved. I stil was needed to help as they were not able to lift the piece. When they arrived with the items to my home I simply said to just use the outside entrance to the basement, place the pieces inside and I will take of the rest. Again, I found myself being needed to help with lifting. The personnel that was tasked with the job knew ahead of time what they were moving. The customer should not be tasked with moving the items. Also I was charged overtime for the incompetence of the moving squad. I was offered a $20 discount. The overtime charge should have been waived due to the circumstances.If I did not help with the lifting I’m sure the charge would have been much higher. Will be using another platform for sure with the next project!",

      "text": "These are not personal issues, but general concerns that should be addressed for all users of the app and service. :\n\nThis is the big one:\nWhen making a reservation, pickup was at a location away from mine. So, I changed the address from my current location to the pickup location. Seeing that I missed entering the unit number,  I went back to add unit # to the address. At that point the app defaulted to change the pickup location to my personal physical location miles away from the actual intended pickup location. I almost didn’t see that it changed automatically.  \nThe app should not change the location that I had entered. The fact that I was in edit mode means that I was handling the addresses - don’t need it to revert to anything.  Perhaps there could be a <use current location> button instead if the intention is for the app o be helpful. Otherwise it’s the opposite of helpful. \n\nPerhaps the issue could be avoided if the unit number had available an “address line 2” instead of having to be input into the “special notes” or “additional info”  (how ever it’s worded).  My driver didn’t even see that it was in the notes because\n It wasn’t part of the address in the app. \n\nIf I didn’t see that I was reverted, driver would be at the wrong address and would likely cancel, therefor would cost extra, frustrate me and cause delays.\n\nSo, there are two things to change that are  critical to this app: \n1.) the app should not default to current location once a different location was already entered to change it from current location; and\n2.) An “address line 2” or unit number should be added to the pickup location.\n\nThe app has a glitch in the customer support portion (went to to a blank screen a couple times). \n\nFinally, There is no way to share the app from within the app. I needed to come back to the App Store to share it. Not convenient. If you seriously want us to share your app, then you should make it as easy as possible to do so.  \n\nYou alone have the power to make these changes. \nMake it so. It would be magnificent if the developers actually used the apps they develop. Don’t just go through it as if it was the real thing. Actually use the service. That’s how apps become great.",

Seconds after I finished, Stephen L. had accepted my job.  I was shocked!  He went out the same evening to pick up my sofa.  Seeing where he was and the progress on line was so reassuring.  Unfortunately, on his way back to my place, the weather decided not to cooperate.  I called him & he was willing to wait until the storm was over or keep my sofa until the morning.  He had excellent communication with me at all times and since the water was ankle high in front of my door, we decided to finish the next morning.  I was so impressed with his service.  It’s rare to find someone who goes the extra mile to make things work.  Stephen L. did that & more.  I will use GoShare in the future and ask for Stephen L. because I trust him with my purchases.",

Goshare provided cost estimate and move duration based on what was provided by us but the truck selected was very small.  Matter of fact the company did not have larger trucks to complete our move.  Since the company does not provide large truck, the driver had to make multiple trips to complete the move which took longer and ultimately increased our move cost significantly.  Instead of GoShare taking the responsibility for sending a small truck and absorbing the additional cost, they charged us for the mistake.   We will be challenging their cost.  Since they have no larger trucks, it tells me that the company is doing this intentionally to bump up their profit margins which should be an unethical practice.",

      "text": "They are, as they say, a startup technology company, and yes, their model is simple: they are trying to be the Uber of moving company, connecting “a man with a truck” to someone who needs AMwAT… so far so good. But the issue is that they don’t do this very well, I suspect because the company is weak and cannot control the “independent contractors” it is trying to connect to customers. My experience has been that I schedule a pick-up/drop-off with them on the app, which goes well and smoothly. Then, I get a barrage of text messages (why not use the app? Isn’t that the point of an App?) telling me about drivers rescheduling, cancelling, wrong size truck sizes arriving, and basically, a lot of your time being wasted and you realise that going to the local U-haul and hiring the couple of day workers there (actually the same guys who do the job anyway!) would have been quicker, less stressful, and easier. So, yes, it is trying to cater to our modern age of “faceless connections” and technology based basic services, but it miserably fails to do so. I am not sure why Uber works and GoShare doesn’t, but the facts lie before you.",

The app is simple to use and we confirmed a next day delivery within minutes of setting up the app. My only complaint is the pricing - which was on the high side for the delivery of only two chairs in my opinion. However, timing was more important than money in this instance so I can’t complain too much. If I wasn’t under time pressure, it would have been less than half the price to simply rent a Home Depot truck for a couple of hours and do the delivery myself with a friend.

The same was done for an armoire. Instead of unwrapping it and taking out the drawers to make it lighter they brought it up the stairs in tact with a very heavy dolly. The stairs walls were banged and scratched very heavily. The movers left all of the trash in the front yard. I was expecting professional movers. The movers were just unfamiliar with what they were doing it seemed like. They didn’t have moving apparatuses which make lifting heavy objects easy like straps. They didn’t seem very strong. I was really worried they were going to damage more than just the walls. I was worried they were going to damage the furniture or hurt themselves. I’ve moved a lot in my lifetime as I am a military spouse. I’ve never felt this uneasy about my items being moved. Only one person stayed behind to assemble a bed.

The movers dragged my furniture on the pavement with no protection damaging them.

The driver came ready with his cargo truck; and loaded/unloaded/handled my couches carefully- very professional with mover blankets and wrapping- I was impressed! Customer service was easy to contact through the app- I had the same representative for two days so she was able to assist me and answer all of my questions!

Don’t use this service they may be convenient but obviously they have hidden fees (They can’t explain them) and no one likes to use a service that is not upfront about cost.

      "text": "We scheduled a move for a Peloton exercise bike and 5 Boxes from Manhattan to Long Island. I booked this ~ 2weeks prior to the move. I was notified via the app that my one driver  and one helper were both confirmed. Out of an abundance of caution I reached out to the Driver 5 days prior to the scheduled pick up and found him to be pleasant and well informed. I reviewed the fact that the Peoloton would require two people as it will need to be taken up one flight of stairs and is very heavy. He confirmed that he understood. On the day of pickup I also texted the driver and got a friendly “ see you there”.  One hour prior to the scheduled pick up I received a call from Go Share customer support that they “can’t find a helper” and could the driver manage alone? I reminded them that the order is clearly visible to them and that it is impossible for any one Person to make the move. After many escalations and back and forth they asked to create a new  project and hope that a pickup could be arranged by 4pm that day. I had a larger move scheduled the next day so I had no flexibility. Meanwhile the original driver is texting me from downstairs a bit u certain of what he is supposed to do.  The experience overall was so stressful I would never do it again. This team has a long way to go to ensure that the coordination, communication and support measures in place really work to make it a reliable “small move” company. Of note the driver and helper who did end up coming were kind and hard working. The issue seems to be more structural and administrative. As of 7:30pm I am still waiting for a call from a manager that I was assured would\nHappen.",

Another email was sent in its place saying now I was now being charged $294. I looked in my checking account....They already took it out of my account!!!  I will be disputing this. It’s funny that the chat history and previous email was withdrawn to cover themselves. So, really, the company scammed me after the fact. The movers told me I wasn’t going to be charged anything other than the estimate. Additionally, they damaged my floor. They admitted to it.

The CRAZY thing is that I did not authorize GoShare to hold anything from my bank account nor was I previously informed.

Later I learned the side of the frige was scratched in the transport. I noticed that the dolly/hand truck was smaller than a regular appliance size dolly (which I thought I had paid for). Also, I don’t believe it had anything to protect the metal from the appliance, thus the scratching. It was in excellent condition before this trip. I have seen pics of the scratches and they will have to be painted over. Had it not been for this damage I would highly recommend them. They should have used a professionally sized appliance dolly, like the one that delivered my new frige. This frige went to a friend and now I will try to cover up the ugly scratching as best I can.

I called Corey who was assigned to me just to see if he needed any more info to get my order from distribution center. He asked me to text my invoice, and he was able to get my order no problem. Getting it in my house however, turned out to be quite a challenge! We had to take off doors, try several different angles, but they were pro’s and got it in!! I was very impressed with them and tipped their excellent service. The only surprise was that the job took quite a bit longer than original estimate, but with a good reason.

The driving brought it to my home all scratched up and just dropped it off and was so non chalant about it. The thing is, it’s a cement top and he didn’t have anything in between that and the bed of his van and just let it all scrap up. I’m so upset about it. Go Share I have wrote them multiple times. It’s been three weeks and they’ve done nothing. $400 down the drain and I can’t even get a new one because home goods is a place that only has one of everything especially furniture.

      "text": "I just bought a home and found a new bathroom vanity that I absolutely loved at Costco. The only problem was it’s a 250lb vanity, already assembled and in a box. Enter GoShare, an app that is so easy to use and made this a breeze. My driver met me at Costco after I had paid for the vanity, and then his helper met us at my house. The two of them got this giant vanity into my house and up the stairs to the 2nd floor bathroom fairly quickly and without damaging any walls. All together, it costed about the same as if I had ordered the vanity on Costco.com with basic curbside delivery from FedEx. Totally worth the money, and would use GoShare again!",

I had shared the pictures too. \n\nWhile the order said there will be 2 people coming, only one person (driver) showed up. He did not have any information of what he was supposed to carry and how heavy that would be. \n\nHe brought it home but could not carry the futon upstairs so left it downstairs saying he will come back. Later when I called, he said he can’t come back and do it for free. So call GoShare to complain. \n\nI had a chat session with help desk. The chat person said place a new order with 2 people and we will give you $10 off and ended the session. \n\nMy credit card is charged without taking any confirmation from me to see if job was done properly.",

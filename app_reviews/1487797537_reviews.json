      "text": "This app is a hot wet mess. It’s beta at best, and has not even gone through basic QA. I will say it’s functional, but only barely. You can’t make changes nor can the movers once they have accepted a job. So you have to contact support to remove one guy, so it frees up the spot to find another helper. Would benefit from some gui/spatial changes to make it more user friendly and/or less intimidating overall.\n\nVisionary/executive/owner/coach?: Storyboard the entire application with branches of what goes to what storyboard. Then look at all your storyboards and redesign to cut the storyboards in half at least. \n\nThe idea is great, and has potential to grab a return and expanding customer base. You have to bring customer engagement down, simplify the order process. It needs to be as easy as Uber/Lyft. A metric to shoot for is easier than Ubereats, that app is still a convoluted mess in places to accommodate all the different restaurants and what have you. You’re defining the service/service level so you can trim and shape to simplify/make brainless easy.\n\n(AWS backend?)",

I contracted for 2 helpers, and 1 canceled at the last minute. The problem is: trying to get to a real person to get anything done didn’t happen. After Dylan, the helper that showed up tried contact you by phone, all we got was a voicemail. That doesn’t help me when I’m in need of a agreed second helper. Almost 3 hours later, you assigned another person, by it was too late. \n2. That being said, the guy that DID show up, Dylan was GREAT! Hard worker, and easy to get along with. I’m almost 68 years old, in decent health, but had I not been, this could have been a catastrophe. Too bad all your helpers aren’t as good as Dylan!",

Or a truck. \nMy friend shared their link on Facebook and after waiting 3 years it was moved the next day!!!! \nThey didn’t have my specific needs on their app, but I messaged them through Facebook and they took care of me. \nI wish I had known about them sooner.

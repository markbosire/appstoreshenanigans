      "text": "In theory, an app is created so that one may automate and create a more seamless experience for the end user. Maybe save some time, possibly create a tool that's useful. This experience may come in the form of ordering a taxi, food for your meal or a rideshare car. \n\nAllegedly that's what lalamove tried to do. But while the App may look shiny and is considerably user friendly, it fails in all other aspects that may suggest a more automated or seamless experience. Some examples- why did I get 8 missed calls from their customer service after using their App? Why was I not able to resolve the issue after the 4 subsequent calls with their team? Why were there multiple drivers calling me? Why didn't the driver correct call me in the first place? Why was I negotiating with the driver til close to midnight on the phone? \n\nWhile training and basic customer service etiquette seemed utterly devoid from my interaction with the lalamove team, it seems the biggest shortfall is in how NOT streamlined the experience is. What should have been a 1 minute App experience turned into a combined 3 hour ordeal. I hope the lalamove team gets it and fixes their approach to their service, as well as reconsider the end users' journey post-click. It Best of luck.",

They have one driver who shuffles every morning between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, so orders to Fujairah and other emirates are totally ignored. They have my package for three days and still haven’t delivered it after numerous calls and complaints. It’s a shame that a company like Samsung is using them for deliveries and not other more reputable and reliable companies. Apple and iPhone will remain my choices for the future, I’ve never had an issue like this with Apple. Samsung-change your delivery company!!",

Promising big and delivering small, in this case, not delivering at all! And the worst thing is, the customer service give an alternative date or try to find a solution! It's like she doesn't care if I use their service or not! This is just a perfect example of how to fail on \"carry\"ing.",

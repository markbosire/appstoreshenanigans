I am unable to edit the review and if I click any rating but 5 stars the app disappears.\n\nIT APPEARS to crash but does not, it hides in the background.\n\nI hope everyone who wrote a line of code for this behavior or stamped it for release has engaged in conspiracy to commit interstate wire fraud.\n\nThat’s a criminal felony.\n\nSCARIER?! Apple will probably ban every single one of you from ever touching anything in the app store again.  Or I will sick the DOJ on Apple for criminal negligence.",

      "text": "I have used the Lugg app a few times to make moved between apartments. It is a valuable service, however unfortunately it is wrought with fraud. The first time was great, because they came right away, moved the few items, and charged a small amount due to efficiency. The second time, the movers purposefully took the long way to the drop off spot to run up my tab, then they broke my dresser and lied about it. The third time, the movers arrived at the location at 12:11 to start the clock on their “labor minutes” but never called or messaged me. I opened the app and saw them driving away at 12:14. I called them, and they said they had to talk to police about a speeding ticket they received on the way over. Then they finally started work at 1pm, wasting 49 labor minutes at my expense, costing me an extra $112.70. I posted a 4 star review for the movers complaining about this and quickly got an email from Lugg explaining how they calculated their charges and making excuses. They finally issued me a refund of only $34.50, which is criminal activity. They owed me $112.70 and refused to make the adjustment despite having a full GPS tracking history of each of the vehicle’s movements as well as my communications with the Luggers.

      "text": "We are new to Lugg and we’re so excited to use what seemed to be such a cost effective and simple solution to such a common problem for so many people.  \n\nThe task was simple: pick up a bed from one house A, deliver to bedroom at house B. \n\n1) my husband and I have five children and were in between multiple locations so we carefully selected the only window of time the lugg app had available in order to accommodate the seller and to be available to be there to receive the bed.  We were supposed to get a call when Lugg was on their way to the pick up location (so I could then notify the seller of the item and try to get to the pick up location to inspect the item and handle any instructions.  We only got a call from Lugg driver once he had arrived at pick up location. \n\n2) when Lugg driver arrived at delivery location, he rang doorbell and indicated that the instructions only said to deliver the bed but didn’t say anything about taking the bed to the upstairs bedroom.  Since this is my first time using the app, I had no idea I had to he so specific about a bed delivery since I was paying for two guys, a delivery fee + a labor rate by the minute. Isn’t that supposed to cover the time the luggers are delivering your items to the appropriate place at your address?\n\n3)  They then asked us to pay them cash, “outside of Lugg” for having to carry the bed to a bedroom in the house.  Which, we did, hesitantly, since this whole situation started feeling sketchy but we were caught between a rock and hard place.  If we weren’t willing to give them the cash, what would have happened? Would they have just dumped the bed in our driveway in the rain/etc. and left it there?!?  We aren’t physically capable of carrying the bed from our driveway into the house which is the whole reason we used Lugg in the first place!!! \n\n4) Well, since we then had to go to atm to get them the cash they requested, they sat in the driveway in their truck and then when they had been paid and left the house, I get a notification from the app that the guys left the house and I was now being charged for 43 minutes of time they just sat there in their truck for cash!!! We got screwed and this is not right! I am furious and feel dooped.",

Your better off renting a truck and or van to move your own items with the help of a friend or relative if you don’t have ether your still better off doing it your self cause no one on this platform is a professional coming from a true professional who worked on this app as a helper you have to be a dispatcher, customer service rep, laborer, several different other categories of management. you would not get any help from Customer Service and then in the likelihood of damages you would be charged with no proof or debating claims you can drop off an item and a customer can damage it and you will be charged point-blank. No discussion no investigation.. Believe me I’ve tried. I’ve even went a step further and equipped, myself with a body camera to have footage of these moves. Booked by Lugg and let me tell you bad bad bad unprofessional from beginning to end and I have the proof my profile will show you. I have over 100 moves, but one bad review due to Lugg telling individuals that we can do the impossible. Once again, I have proof screenshots of messages videos email sent. to Customer Service and let me tell you they do not care so don’t waste your time working or booking any moves to this company trash",

I got a message 15 min before our pickup  window that the luggers were finishing their last Lugg and we would get an ETA shortly. We waited and waited and heard nothing.  After our window passed I tried customer service and they told me they “hoped” to have movers assigned soon. The store we bought from closed so they helped us get our furniture outside. Thankfully a friend came to our rescue and I canceled the Lugg. I’ll be double checking to make sure I didn’t get charged. Won’t be using this service again.",

At first they arrived at pick up location late then what we scheduled took ample of time to load 4 mini wardrobe and took their sweet time to arrive at drop off location then they had this issue to find out the building it was so hard to coordinate with them as there was language barrier instead of hiring two luggers my partner had to help them to move stuff after all this they charged me $229 while I booked for $50 and now there is no one to help me with my concerns all I can do is talk to bot! Is this the way to help customers? The first time I booked lugg I had this giant cal mattress to be picked and drop and it was with one lugger I had no issues everything went so well and this time even after having two luggers this many issues I had to deal with top of that why should I pay unexpected amount for your staff mistake completely not acceptable.

I was also given zero heads up that this would be the case from the support team.

The item we moved ended up being disassembled prior to pick up which was unanticipated, so I asked the Lugg experts if they are able to assemble at the drop off destination. I thanked them profusely for accommodating and tipped significantly on the side as I felt they went above and beyond to accommodate me. They did not inform me that I was being charged by Lugg for the labor time. So a $70 quote ended up being over $440 after the extra tipping. I really wish they disclosed that I was being charged by the app. The changes are logical but it was very clear that I thought they were being helpful and was unaware of the additional charge structure beyond the initial quote. If Lugg could meet me somewhere in the middle by refunding some of the labor fees I would be very grateful and continue to use this app regularly, now that I understand how it works.",

THE MOVERS ON THIS APP ARE NOT VETTED OR ACCREDITED MOVERS, THESE GUYS DAMAGED A $7000 SOFA AND THEY ARE DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT!!!!! THESE GUYS ARE CONNIVING CON ARTISTS!!!!!!!!!!!!! When you read the lugg info page and request movers it says they bring straps, Dollies and protective gear. They did no such thing, two Joe schmo looking people showed up, retrieved the sofa and proceeded to literally launch it down my stairs, nearly killing themselves, they damaged my walls, they ripped the sofa, broke the frame. When we arrived to the storage unit the sofa was shoved around corners and literally forced through the door where two of the feet broke off and parts of the frame began splintering from the force at which it was shoved into the unit. I feel scammed, I feel defeated, and I’m utterly reeling over the entire experience. I feel like I just made the largest mistake of my life entrusting my items with this company and I wish I could rewind and take back every second of it.\n\nUpdate: Lugg got back to me with 2 options, the first was to keep the sofa and they would send me $400 to repair it. This sofa has extensive frame damage and the fabric is destroyed—a new slipcover costs nearly 2k and to have an 8-way hand tied sofa repaired also costs THOUSANDS what a joke!!!!!!! The second option was that I could dispose of the sofa and they’d send me 1400–BUT I apparently have to schedule the disposal through Lugg and find a dump site for the sofa. Boston doesn’t have public dump sites, we have to leave the furniture on the street and schedule a bulk pickup. Lugg said that this option isn’t feasible. I then asked Lugg if they can set up a junk removal service to come pick it up and they said no. So it really seems like Lugg doesn’t want to do the right thing and definitely isn’t taking any responsibility in their damaging my belongings. Would give 0 stars to this entire company, I hope it goes bankrupt",

They said they didn’t even look at the dimensions, photo etc. until they arrived to pick it up. They also informed us that they didn’t have straps to tie it down. I’m not sure how they thought they were moving anything without straps or looking at the details of the move. I was looking forward to using them with all the great reviews, unfortunately it didn’t work out for us. Just caution if you need help moving appliances I would definitely go with another company",

They did not tell me that if they needed to drive to my storage unit more than one time, which was 1.5 miles away it would be considered another trip and I would need to rebook the van for $117! What a ripoff! \nHad I known, I would have paid better attention to how the van was being packed, as well as not given them all the little things and brought them myself. \nWhen I emailed the company, the reply was a link with “here it is in the terms of service” and no we are not refunding your money, you will pay for the van two times for each round trip 3 mile drive. What bad business! Ok, so maybe I should’ve known, and also maybe it would’ve been good customer service for Lugg to send me something that spelled out the terms of service. I received NOTHING from them. Also, it would have been nice for the movers to give me the heads up, “just so you know, if we make another trip, you will be charged for the moving van again!” Getting charged $117 again to go 3 miles round trip is nothing to say “oh well” over. I tipped the movers generously, over $100. To split. \nLugg sees nothing wrong with these charges. \nBeware! I will not be using them again. They are not keen on customer service at all!",

Dont use Lugg for big moves.Lugg XL is not a moving truck, it's a sprinter van. My movers spent most of the time ($$$) deciding on how to fit my furniture.\n\n2. My furniture got damaged. I guess because I boxed everything up myself, they didn't bother to wrap my furniture with blankets. I ended up getting scratches on my tv stand, couch, and dining chair. \n\n3. Charging begins when their GPS says they are at pickup. But this doesn't take into account parking! My movers ate up 30 minutes just trying to settle parking even though it was indoor garage parking\n\n4. Predatory pricing model. Because of the pay-per-minute, I felt compelled to help out with the move to speed things along. I was the only one with a sense of urgency. God knows how long it would have taken without my hand. Honestly I didn't realize how screwed I got until the movers left and I got slapped with a fat bill. I literally just worked with them for several hours and then got handed a $700 bill and damaged furniture.\n\nThis is my first app store review and hopefully my last.

They take hours or even days to respond to emails making it useless when you have an issue during a move. I would never use Lugg again after this. Oh btw the rating prompt in the app is broken probably intentionally- if you give your luggers  less than 3 stars it won’t do anything when you press save.

I know for sure a Greg saw it break but he did not bring it to my attention. I pointed it out and all four movers acknowledged that that damage was caused by them) \n- more damaged property (a new pottery barn Mateo head board that was dropped by my first Luggers of the day and tore the wood straight off the upper corner. This occurred with Matthew and Tejas.) \n- terrible customer service (poor attitudes, lack of motivation, unnecessary commentary and verbal complaining, general laziness, and they were physically unable to do the job) \n- trespassing and unacceptable behavior (Greg was seen at the pick up location walking behind my mothers property. He returned after a minute or two and we assume he was urinating in our back yard)\n- excess charges (we were billed for them to sit around and wait in our front drive way for pick up while the other Lugg crew drove the larger van from over an hour away) \n- stolen property (a wooden $250 book shelf that was loaded onto Greg’s silver pick up truck. The shelf never made it to my apartment and i currently do no know it’s whereabouts. This is absolutely unacceptable and if it is not returned to me, I will have no choice but to file a police report for stolen property.)\n\nI am requesting a full refund for: Matthew and Tejas ($371 before tip, they did not complete the task requested and damaged furniture), Cally and Almir’s time ($365, they did not complete the task requested and damaged furniture), Efosa and Greg’s time ($301, they did not complete the task requested, damaged furniture, trespassed on my property, and stole a bookshelf), and reimbursement for all damaged and destroyed items. \n\nPlease respond to me at your earliest convenience.

      "text": "We scheduled a Lugg a week in advance of the moving date. On the morning of, we got a text notification that the Luggers were on the way and should arrive on time. Well an hour passed and our moving window that we had scheduled closed. There is no way to call Lugg or reach out to the movers to see why they are so late. There is only an email address which does not offer a quick response (I didn’t get the email until the next day). We waited around for hours and the Luggers never arrived. We had to scramble to find other movers for our emergency move. I’ve never been screwed over so hard by a moving “company”. This is an absolute scam!",

Was hesitant at first but decided to give it a try. GLAD I DID!! Compared to traditional moving companies, they offer more flexibility in terms of time, cost. There’s no minimum hours, it all depends on how much stuff you have (price per minute). So it’s fair and reasonable. They’re also very on time. They let us know when the movers are on the way through messages and also update every progress through messages. Very transparent and innovative. The Lugg app is very nice, informative and easy to understand. \n\nMy stuff was moved safely and in good condition, no damage. They’re very dedicated when handling our fragile stuff. They deserve a good review and that’s why I did this here. \n\nI love Lugg and want to use and support Lugg. The product like Lugg is transforming the moving industry, making it more customer friendly, affordable and hi-tech.  \n\nPlease keep up the great work! I’m rooting for you!",

Then they take their time moving and wrapping very slowly, much slower than the other moving services I used. I’m guessing it’s because the slower they are, the more labor minutes are counted, and the more they will earn. It’s like if Uber is charged by minutes and driver takes detour to get you there. It’s horrible experience watching them wrapping and inching slowly while I’m in a hurry to finish up moving and continue with my work. I even helped them move because they are so slow and I couldn’t stand it. Then I contacted Lugg support. And there was no response. I WILL NEVER USE LUGG AFTER THIS TIME.\n\nUpdate:\nCustomer support told me they refunded me 10 dollars for courtesy reason and claimed there is not wrong in their calculation that only 31 minutes were counted yet the app clearly shows 40+67 minutes were counted respectively at pickup and destination. After I responded that, customer support never care to respond again. What’s worse, I don’t even see that 10 dollars refunded in my bank. What a customer service I can only say.",

I have no doubt Lugg have great personality workers however there are many areas to improve and it’s really depend who comes to service on that day. In my opinion, I strongly suggest to have professional movers if you’re planning to relocate 1 bed room size furniture. The professional mover have 17 feet depth truck (vs Lugg’s XL Van-10 feet) and faster to make action which it will be much cheaper labor hours to have the best results for 100%.

Though not all driver but it Lugg who is to blame for not making transparency \n\nMy case load time was 3 min 46 seconds but I was charged for 15 minutes.\n\nAlways check time else you are being over charge for sure. I noticed this after 4 Lugg charging me more then I expected and then decided to track on 5th one...and I saw they over charged me for 15 minutes...and cold response on refund when asked on clarity\n\nDriver comes early you get charged but if they are late you won’t get compensation. They don’t honor your comment but do say add as drivers read it...but usually that goes to drain and they find new avenue to charge you more on time...so be careful.",

I gave them specific instructions how to pack effectively. Pack larger furniture items first and get everything out of apartment to loading dock. This did not happen. \n\nIn the time they milked the clock I packed van and suv and made three trips to new apartment. \n\nThey could not find new address. \n\nOn top of this, I had to simultaneously hire MORE movers to complete the job!\n\nI told this first crew to unpack at loading dock because i didn’t want to pay them to WASTE more of my time by being slow AF and inefficient.\nThe second crew was AMAZING professional, had an actual xl truck and were kind enough to assist me in transporting ALL of the furniture the first crew left behind. \nThis second crew was about to get the items left at loading dock into my new unit in a FRACTION of the time the first crew WASTED by being slow AF. \n\nCustomer service did not respond to my multiple inquiries during this process. \nThey finally responded after they could not OVERCHARGE me for the first crew. \n\nI advised that I would pay for the actual services rendered but not for them milking the clock and not actually completing the move. I literally moved more than the first crew which completely defeated even hiring them in the first place- they were literally horrible and I hope no one is unlucky enough to hire them. \n\nThey charged me double of what it cost to move into my apartment with LUGG team with less furniture. \n\nAnd let’s not forget I had to HIRE ANOTHER LUGG TEAM to complete their sloppy job\n\nIt’s unfortunate because moving is stressful enough and then to get robbed of your money and time is just not ok. \n\nSo book at your own risk!\nI happily PAID in full with generous tip, the SECOND TEAM. \n\nI have no intention of paying the padded fees of first team, yet will pay them for the limited service rendered but LUGG management wants more money...\n\nI suppose my witnesses, myself and my bank will now have to waste our time fighting being overcharged!\n\nReally too bad...",

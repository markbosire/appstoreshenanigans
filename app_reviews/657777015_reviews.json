      "text": "This had potential to be a great and accessible shared ride service, except it’s not. Don’t expect to rely on this service if you are looking for a reliable way to commute in the city. Many times even calling over an hour in advance results in me still arriving late to my destination for several reasons including, poor ETA time, rides with no updates which results in you having to cancel AND occasionally pay to do so. In my particular city there is a great cultural and language barrier which prevents the driver from even being friendly. I’ve personally watched my ride arrive after an hour only to speed off in front of me to do random new pickup requests. Yes, the app lets you monitor all of this including your drivers location. Occasionally Drivers will even mark you as picked up when you are not, they will check off they have arrived at the location when they haven’t. I’ve gotten into cars that are filthy, with no seats, etc. They need a more serious background check to who they are hiring, many of the drivers are unfamiliar with the area, pooor driving skills, driving barefoot, rude, etc.",

Not to mention the fact they don’t have ACTUAL WORKING CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBERS where you can speak to an actual human when you need to. You can’t get ahold of drivers anymore either.

This happened directly after riders took surveys. At the end of the day, the timing doesn’t bother me. You don’t order a via if you’re in a rush or trying to get somewhere in a timely manner.

When you go and try to report them through the website you have nonchalant, non-caring representatives that do not help you in anyway. do you now end abusing around $500 because I have to keep counseling as they all do the same tactic. They are not willing to fire anyone because nobody wants to work with them in the first place so they keep on hiring these bad drivers. Not to mention that a lot of them pick and choose on who they want to pick up and take them out of zone, inconveniencing you when you’re in the car. My best experience with via was probably in 2021,  after that, everything went down hill. you better off ordering an Uber.",

When you tell the app your location they make you do tedious walking in the heat to meet the driver. It is too hot right now in Texas to do any tedious walking but I digress. I told the app where I needed to go but the GPS had the driver drop me off across the street from my desired location. It was during the lunch rush hour so I was not going to walk across the busy street. Luckily the driver was able to drop me off where I needed to be. Lastly, on my pickup from my lunch spot the driver didn’t know where I was even though he drove right past me. I called and tried re-directing him but he gave up and cancelled my ride. Leaving me stranded. I had to call a LYFT to take me back to work. I recommend not using this app because it’s confusing and inconvenient.",

Some of them are great but far too many are downright scary to drive with. It’s a crap shoot as to whether my 12 minute ride will be a roller coaster or a chauffeured limo where I’m not holding on and hoping we don’t hit another car. Also, the wait times are awful. They say you’ll be picked up within 15 minutes on average, but it’s more like 40 minutes and that’s if you don’t get bumped to another vehicle which delays your trip or you get a text saying your driver is delayed and it tells you to cancel your ride if like. As I said, the concept is great but the transit needs to go in house or hire another company who can do it better and with integrity.",

Firstly I couldn’t get any rides but somehow other people were getting picked up in via cars in front of me at the bus stop, so there couldn’t have been no rides available in the area when I saw plenty. Then I finally got a ride after 15 minutes of repeatedly tapping the retry button, but it seemed that the driver kept getting farther away from where I was and stopped moving for several minutes, then just when the ride was 8 minutes away from me, it got cancelled. So I frustratedly tried to get another one and each time I saw one available somehow the seat got taken, this happened over 7 times, I eventually got on a bus because the app kept saying it couldn’t find any available rides and when it did, someone apparently took it 1.5 seconds after it appeared for me. I would rate this app zero stars if I could. Very disappointed, I was recommended to try this app because it was more affordable than lyft and uber, but I’d rather take those than ever try this again, waste of time (literally). Don’t try via if you have to be somewhere important at a certain time. Thankfully I didn’t try this to get to work.",

That happens about 50 percent of the time. \n\nThere have been problems when waiting for a driver. There have been at least four times that I clearly remember where I ordered a ride and then the driver starts going the other way. \n\nToday I used Via. There was a 20 minute wait. It took 30 minutes. When the driver picked me and another passenger up, the navigation had us going in circles. We were able to figure it out on our own. We added another passenger in the small SUV. With the SUV already full, the driver got another request. On my ride alone, she had to be on the phone with VIA support twice. \n\nI don’t think these are an anomaly but more systematic issues. \n\nI do sometimes get drivers who hand hold their phones while navigating. All Via drivers should have phone mount devices.",

EASY. ive been picked up here a billion times. but after standing and waiting for 20 minutes, the via is near my school im happy but then they continue to go the wrong way TWICE. they need people who can actually use their gps and maps because i swear its not that hard. thought this was gonna be a cheap and convincing way to get from point a to point b but this app is so inaccurate that it hurts. they never drop me off exactly where i need them to. they've dropped me off in front of random peoples houses down the street from my house on multiple occasions. i rather spend an extra $5 for a uber if it means i get a better experience through a rideshare and thats that.",

      "text": "I enjoyed the rides and they were very convenient when I was in the area, but it was a pain when I had to get in the area when my school was right around the corner (but a very tedious walking distance). Some of the drivers were willing to take me there regardless of me not being able to pinpoint anything in Webster Groves on the Via GPS, which is why I gave it 2 stars, but the other drivers took me as far as the Via GPS would go and barely more, even though they were seemingly allowed to go further. Then my 2nd issue, which is even bigger is……….I left my wallet in one of the Viacles (didn’t have money in it at all)………..but now it’s gone. What’s worse is that I called them for so many days and talked to so many different people just to eventually find out that my wallet wasn’t it their vicinity anymore (they customer service got extremely tedious after a while, so I tell you, PLEASE DO NOT EVER forget to turn around and check the seat before you leave the vehicle, PLEASE, because it is not worth not looking. It was my fault of course, but honestly, they could’ve helped me out and got it back to me). Oh and p.s. if you lost something, don’t try to email them, because they likely won’t respond at all.",

I literally called friends to call rides for me to avoid using this app because it’s just disappointing and makes me late for everything. Calling a ride takes forever as you go through the process of putting in your addresses for it to tell you they’re too busy and make you start all over. Why can’t you just leave the addresses in and let me try again? \n\nFor a shared ride, these are way more expensive, longer waits, and less available than private rides. Living in DC, a super active city, it’s a hassle to have to wait 20-25 min for each ride and then have to walk to meet them. There’s also the safety issue of catching them at night. As a young female living in the city, it’s not cool to have to walk 4 blocks at 2 am after a long night out. \n\nIn Summary, this app needs:\nMore drivers\nCloser meeting/dropoff spots\nDoor dropoff for late night rides\nShorter pickup times \nCheaper shared rides\nMore convenient interface",

No problem at all.\n\nThe issue comes in with Via not allowing you to remove an additional cards over that one default card that is required. So if you’ve used 2 or 3 additional cards, the app will not allow you to remove them. The app claims it cannot remove them due to “signal issues” but yet the app still manages to request rides and updates your location just fine with those same “signal issues.”\n\nPretty crummy that want to hold customers financial information like that. I recommend sticking with Uber and Lyft. Trusted, tried and true. The little guys like Via are not worth it all. Much more trouble than they’re worth.

Today I waited 40 minutes for a via that was originally “6” minutes away!! This is the longest this has ever happened to me but definite not the first (this currently happens every single time to varying degrees). I finally contacted customer support who told me the driver have been disconnected from the app so they would send me a new one... WHY DIDNT THEY TELL ME THAT BEFORE?!!!

So you would think that Via would follow suit to protect their customers, right? Wrong. The wait times are 20+ minutes which I can tolerate, there is a short walk to the pickup location which I can tolerate, the rides are cheap which I love BUT riding in the car with several strangers in the mist of a pandemic?? THATS SO IRRESPONSIBLE! I rather pay $10 more on another app to know that I’m not increasing my chance of catching COVID. Via has officially lost a rider.",

It is inconsistent, annoying, and it has made me late countless times. \n\nMy advice, if you want to use this app, call your ride 30 minutes plus how long it takes to drive there from when you need to get there. That seems to be the balance. If you don’t want to ever be late, add 10 minutes to that. \n\nThe customer service? From what I’ve seen when I rated this, the top 5 ratings were 4 ones and 1 two. All of them with service issues, and not ONE reply or any feedback. None of them has had updates or edits telling what happened. Some of these ratings happened 1 YEAR AGO.\n\nOverall, good idea, good drivers, horrible customer service, inconsistent and bad app. There are much better options.",

It's often cheaper than both Uber(well, pre-drama) and Lyft and pretty comfy and quick. Add the cancel feature in (or a way to request refunds or make other complaints, like Uber has) and I'll up it to at least 4 stars (5 if match Uber's level for the trip options)",

It saddens me to leave this negative review. \n\nI understand that my most recent ride with Via was during NYC rush hour, but my rideshare picked up a total of 5 passengers. This meant all the seats were taken, going against the current CDC guidance that people maintain 6 feet between us to prevent the spread of coronavirus. \n\nShame on Via for putting profits and squeezing as many passengers into a single car as possible, over the health of your passengers, during this critical public health juncture.",

Each ride allows you to apply an $8 credit to your ride. The issue is they’re over charging by 20-50% more at times than uber or Lyft.\n\nThe rides also take longer to arrive than the other car services. Stay away.",

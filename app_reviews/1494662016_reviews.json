      "text": "Let’s be very clear. This app is a complete and utter scam. Do NOT send them any money!  \n\nI paid the fee to join the service thinking I would be able to get some quick moving hauling jobs and build a side income this way.  \n\nI submitted to literally 90% to 95% of the supposedly “available” jobs on the app and got ZERO responses back from hundreds of communications!  Couldn’t even get a “piss off!” Or a “no thanks”!  \n\nAnd when I communicated my displeasure via customer support I also got ZERO response back and it’s not been well over a month since I joined.  \n\nWow! So incredible that this app is even here trying to scam people some more! \n\nYou have been warned! \n\nI truly wish I could give this app less than a 1 star! A negative five stars would be more appropriate",

      "text": "I was excited once I came across the opportunity to utilize this app to make some money on the side. I quickly realized that after the $35 “non-refundable” registration fee, they really don’t care. They app really isn’t functional to efficiently communicate with those seeking help (coming from the movers perspective). There is no way to view the location of the job you HAVE to apply to in order for the location to be shown. The contact information isn’t available either. I still have a message in customer support (via the app) that hasn’t been responded to (sent on 3/12/20 @2:19pm). I’ve also sent a follow up email. Still no response. Overall, I completely wasted my $35 and I regret spending it with this company. Please stay away. You’ve been warned. I would’ve given 0 starts if I could.",

      "title": "Don‚Äôt sign any contracts!",
      "text": "I signed a contract with Silver Scripts which is a government program for Seniors! After I heard about how they allow men in the showers with young women ( a photo was in social media showing a 12 year old girl sitting on a bench in the women‚Äôs dressing room with only a towel rapped around her) while a man and trust me you can tell it‚Äôs a male is standing next to her!! A woman asked him to leave the dressing room and he refused because he said I now identify as a woman! And so she took the photo and went to the manager and asked them to please remove the man because there is a child in a towel!! They told the woman she was out of line and she was thrown out and her membership canceled! So when I saw the photo and heard about the situation as a former teacher and having a degree in Childhood development my first inclination is of course always to protect children-ALWAYS!! So my husband and I only pay extra for the ‚Äú black area since silver script pays for our gym membership!! \n   So next my husband called our bank to cancel our Black card membership and I called silver script to make sure they wouldn‚Äôt continue to pay and they informed me I didn‚Äôt even need to let them know or the gym because if we don‚Äôt attend they don‚Äôt pay the gym!! \n  So we thought we did our due diligence!! Next thing I know my husband says he looks at one of his credit cards and Planet Fitness is taking payments from his credit card! So I call and I am very upset!! So come to find out when the guy , Jon,  finally told me not only did the have our bank account we gave them to pay the ‚ÄúBlack area ‚Äúthey  somehow got another of my credit cards? I was livid because they got that card when I purchased something at the gym. \n   So to sum it all up. I went down to the gym because now according to the manager , ‚Äú Jess\nAka Jessica , we should have been told to come in person to cancel the membership ( although that still isn‚Äôt always 100% but be careful because they are shady!) they can do it over the phone it just depends on who you talk to and when. But Jess wanted to make a point and she was arguing with me there was no original but I remember signing a piece of paper and what they handed me certainly was not what I had originally signed and in fact you can‚Äôt even read the silver script government ID numbers because when they cut and pasted they covered over it!   \n    I asked for my original contract I signed and they told me no such thing! Everything is inside their computer. So here‚Äôs what they handed me and this is why you should never use your debit, credit or even sign up for planet fitness: they handed me a contract  with two bank accounts, a debit card, my government account-‚Äú  silver script number and finally a final credit card. So in total they had four different credit accounts to draw from. And they had written down three different dates with my signatures. Now if I was going to give them my credit I would do it all at the same time!!! And what was even worse they put\n ‚Äú staff  Initial ‚Äú just the word no persons initial !!! Because no real person saw me write it or witnessed it!! \n    My son in law actually does contracts for Banks and corporations. I‚Äôm going to be sending him the contract they gave me. You can even tell on the first page it looks like it was cut and pasted! \n    So you know how you hear there‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch!! When they say it‚Äôs only $10 a month DON‚ÄôT  GO  THERE!! DON‚ÄôT SIGN ANYTHING!! DON ‚ÄòT TAKE YOU‚ÄôRE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY DON‚ÄôT care as ABOUT CHILDREN EITHER! DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS THEY SAY ITS FREE FOR CHILDREN BUT LOOK AT WHO ELSE SHOWS UP AND HANGS OUT IN THE DRESSING ROOMS!!! \n   So protect yourselves and your children!! \nRESEARCH GYMS. IF YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA BUT THEY ARE HONEST THEN ITS WORTH IT! Don‚Äôt ever use your cards there because they somehow got access to two bank accounts a debit and a credit card and they had access to my government account!!",

However, lately I have noticed a decline in the upkeep of the facility. Lately, a number of pieces of equipment (at least 7) have gone months without being repaired. I find it hard to understand why spare replacement parts aren‚Äôt stocked. Additionally, at least 4 of the TV monitors have been frozen for the past 4 weeks. Two weeks ago I asked the manager specifically about tv monitor #4, since it‚Äôs set on CNN, which I like to watch and listen to with my earphones while on the treadmill. He stated that he would look into it but 2 weeks later, the streaming link is still broken. I don‚Äôt understand why a different working  tv monitor can‚Äôt be tuned in to CNN while the connection problem is investigated and fixed. I hope someone will look into the issues in the Telshore location and take action to resolve them. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.",

Yeah! you're an *sshole, you called me and all my coworkers racist, you're an *sshole!\" Ben proceeded  the front desk counter and having to be physically restrained by a female employee who was clearly restraining him with her own physical body to prevent further escalation from planet fitness's employee at prescott, az, BEN. BEN continued to not follow his employee conduct that he agreed to when working on the clock as a planet fitness employee, in uniform, without his name tag on. How convenient for ben huh? He decides hes gonna swear at me, double down on his lies about something i never had said and take even further by annoucing it to all his co workers anf members passing by. Not only sharing, but lying about it all in the process, slandering my reputation and my conduct with his false public statements. Thankfully not the manager but another employee seen what BEN was doing  and actually follows their guidelines which i think goes without saying is never to use profanity and conduct yourself in a threatening, egregious, abhorrent   manner the way BEN was doing on 9/10 , from moment i scanned in 11:15 til when I left after my business was done with my workout. The GM at this location, Randy will permit and allow employees like BEN, to break protocol when he sees it suffice. Rules are black and white, not grey. This Planet fitness management will state to you its against their policies to record anything they say because they do not want anything as far as employement termination coming back to them. They will state they do not see such evidence in their camera recordings and will disregard any evidence that is plain and clear to see to cover their own security over actually following their employee conduct handbook and standing up for their members against disrespectful employees like BEN. BEN was permitted to swear at me , call me *sshole multiple times, get so unprofessional that other co workers step in between himself and the pathway towards me to prevent him from getting physical altercation with me. If you tell them how to improve their gym in confidential member survey, this location in particular will allow employees like Ben to swear at members, misquote them in a slandering , threatening way for all to hear in the gym,  and for managers like Randy to permit it and vouch for their employees disrespecful, egregious, threatening, conduct towards members they feel like discriminating against like myself not just cause or reason.",

However members are aware that they are paying for this service out of their monthly fees and/or from the annual fees they‚Äôre being charged for at the location where they signed up. Apparently, it has been weeks, if not months with no available fitness coaches throughout the  LA locations. Who do we report this to? Perhaps the district managers? It just seems that they are not seeking or hiring them out of due diligence and rather letting this part of the job slip. Also their app lets you schedule the appointment times with the opening slots even though there are no trainers available for those times at all. Goodness, that is misleading. The staff are aware of this issue yet they don‚Äôt seem to take this up to the corporate. If they did the it should‚Äôve been somewhat fixed by now. However if you don‚Äôt have coaches at your locations, let the members be aware of it by posting signs at the gym so they know the current update. We‚Äôd love to see those classes to become available with what they‚Äôre claiming on the PF website!",

My youngest gets the student summer pass but needed me to take her. Unfortunately, with work and band camp we couldn‚Äôt get there. She was free. I wasn‚Äôt. I noticed that I had another $49 fee about a month after I signed up. This is an annual fee. Maybe I didn‚Äôt read the fine print, but why would I be charged another $49 less than two months after joining? IMHO the sign up should include the year fee. I feel I just wasted $145 for I won‚Äôt be refunded the annual fee. So, I believe sign up should include all fees and yearly fees be charged one year after joining. There shouldn‚Äôt be a blanket charge each July/August. Had I joined in September I wouldn‚Äôt have had this annual fee until the next summer. I‚Äôd have canceled by then.

      "text": "I strongly advise against choosing this health club chain. They have extremely underhanded business practices and very poorly kept facilities. I had so many, many issues with them in the clubs that I went to in the few years that I did use them.  And I had used three different clubs in the area since I do local traveling.  It wasn‚Äôt just an issue with one bad club; they are all like this.  All three had issues.  \n\nThe list is long - freezing cold men‚Äôs locker room in one, nonworking showers in all of them regularly, people leaving weights everywhere and not cleaning up after themselves because no one makes them, tvs not working, cardio equipment not working, one played Spanish music all the time (literal Spanish singing, like we were south of the border), another played LOUD ghetto rap all the time, inadequate amount of equipment for the amount of members (regularly had to wait for equipment, dragging your workout much longer than it should be), VERY limited range of equipment (none have a bench press machine, nor a squat rack!), and that‚Äôs just the stuff off the top of my head.\n\nAfter I moved, there was no planet fitness near me.  Plus, my college had a MUCH better gym that I could use for free. I had no locked in commitment to them, just a monthly agreement that I could cancel at anytime.  But, as soon as I did try to cancel, they had a ton of hoops for me to jump through. They required me to go to the original gym. I signed up at. That gym was now hours away from me, so that was completely unfeasible. the other gyms refused to let me cancel, though, and used the excuse that I had to go to that one, like they didn‚Äôt all have me in the system!  Just a scam to try to get you stuck with them by giving you a huge inconvenience if you move.\n\nThe other option was to send a written letter requesting to cancel. I did this, and with tracking no less to confirm they got it.  They STILL claimed they never got my letter, even though I had confirmation from the tracking that they did!!!\n\nThese illegitimate and literally illegal excuses to try to keep you locked into a non-binding contract. Even though I haven‚Äôt used their facility in nearly a year now, they still try to act like I‚Äôm supposed to be paying them monthly!!! Fortunately, no collections agencies will accept their debts, because they all know they are illegitimate and can‚Äôt actually collect on them legally.\n\nAnyway, it‚Äôs not worth saving the money. There are multiple other options you can use where yes, you will pay a little bit more, but you will have much better equipment, a much better kept facility, and if you move or have something else come up where you need to cancel, they aren‚Äôt going do something as underhanded as this company does try to keep you locked into something that you were never locked into to begin with. Look around the Internet, everyone else has the same exact issues. They are reputation is absolutely horrible because of it. I strongly, strongly advise you go somewhere else, or if you have already signed up and that‚Äôs why you have the app, I suggest you go to the gym you signed up at and cancel immediately while you still can.",

Well, somehow they got the information of a card I activated like a week ago through an entirely different bank and charged me for past and current months. I call them and ask how they got this number and some stoner kid was on there saying they require two forms of payment at sign up, so that must be how they got it. I was like how did you get a card that I just activated last week, 5 years ago when I opened the account? ‚ÄúUhhhhhhhhh here call abc PFHealth,‚Äù didn‚Äôt even know the number just like I was supposed to know who that is.

      "text": "I joined Planet Fitness when my daughter‚Äôs father joined so we could go as a family, he could help with our daughter etc. Unfortunately, I became paralyzed due to a serious staph infection inside my spine that spread to my bloodstream, bone, heart & brain.  Needless to say, I was hospitalized for months prior to being transferred to a rehabilitation facility learning how to sit, stand, walk, take care of my daughter, etc.  I had called the club asking about canceling my membership, but was told I had to come inside the club to do so.  I explained that I was not only paralyzed, but I‚Äôm hospitalized & have no idea when I‚Äôll be discharged, let alone be released ny doctos to go to the club.  Informed them they can easily check and see that I‚Äôve never once been able to go to the facility.  Eventually I was discharged from the rehabilitation center & learned how to walk with the assistance of a cane and went to planet fitness to cancel my membership, however I wasn‚Äôt able to do so since it was during the midnight shift and needed to come back during the day.  I‚Äôve been in and out of the hospital ever since due to a weakened immune system, haven‚Äôt been able to return since.  Meanwhile Planet Fitness has definitely made sure to withdraw the $25.05 every single month for almost 2 years now. They make it so easy to join to their gym online without any issues, but it‚Äôs absolutely impossible to cancel without going in personally! Just something to think about, nobody plans on traumatic injuries or accidents happening causing the inability to drive, walk or be hospitalized for months, but Planet Fitness definitely takes advantage of people when those situations happen, and I‚Äôm still to this day having to pay for a membership that I‚Äôm not able to take advantage due to health problems and this has been ongoing for 2 entire years now!!!  Just something to consider if you plan on joining their facility online. I used to be personal trainer and as a music Dj created Zumba tracks for several fitness centers across the country prior to health issues. Thankfully I still remain in contact with about 90% of my clients so I‚Äôve definitely been able to share my experience & problems with Planet Fitness. I may only have about 10,000 followers, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs probably made some type of impact on their new memberships in the Chicagoland area.",

I showed him the transaction history that shows that I paid for my membership and was still exited from the building.

I was there the other day with two bars and it was pretty busy. I had to wait to use some equipment, and at that point I checked again and it had 3 bars. It never filled in more bars than that though. So by this logic 4 bars should be maxed out; or 5 bars MAYBE if there are like, lines to use everything! Why would it go up to TEN BARS and make us think it isn‚Äôt busy! The fact that PF tries to make it LOOK like it isn‚Äôt very busy renders the whole thing useless and deceptive. \n\nI thought it was a neat feature that I‚Äôd use a lot when I signed up, but now I see it‚Äôs only a marketing ploy and PF is a lot busier than anyone would ever want. You should be truthful about it and 3 bars should really be around 7. Or change it to 5 bars being the max. Either way, the way it‚Äôs set up now with 10 bars and only having it at 2-3 all week long is misleading and pointless.",

      "text": "Following an embarrassingly unpleasant experience at Planet Fitness, Aramingo Avenue, Philadelphia, I strongly advise against visiting or joining this gym. \nI visited Planet Fitness in my quest for a well equipped, accessible gym in the area and after finding it a suitable place decided to join it. But minutes later the manager attitude left no room for me to come back to the gym again. \nAfter making my mind to join the gym, I took permission from the staff on the front desk for a short video of the place. I thought I will encourage my acquaintance as well to join and show them how well equipped it was. As soon as I started making video with my mobile, a visibly angry woman appeared ordering me to stop filming. I turned off the camera and explained that I did it with permission from the front desk. She, however, said that she is the manager and asked me if I would stop the video or would prefer to be expelled. I told her that I already turned off the camera and that I expect her to say the same thing gently but she grew angrier asking me how did I enter the gym. Since she was making me feel very awkward, I came back to the front desk staff to explain that I was using camera after getting her permission but that lady there was behaving very rough. While I said this, the manager arrived and angrily asked me why I was speaking there again. To avoid the increasingly embarrassing situation, I left the gym feeling more like I had an encounter with a gangster rather than a gym manager. \nMy sincere advice for new gym aspirants is don‚Äôt visit or join this gym if you don‚Äôt want to be treated by unprofessional and arrogant staff. Every person deserves respect.",

I could understand if I damaged something or did something but none of that have I done at workout anytime I have felt more welcome at Planet fitness then workout anytime. All I had to do yesterday was call planet fitness and the guy up front told me I was welcome to come with my daughter. The only suggestion I have for planet  fitness is on the app putting a place for pictures to be took inside the app. To keep track of your progress. Other then that I have enjoyed it at planet fitness and was thankful to the staff who aloud me to be a guest before I joined!",

Great Hydro beds and massage chairs obviously my favorite thing the gym offers the massage bed. Clean bathroom,  customer service is average, staff not too friendly definitely not outgoing to my standard but not rude or non responsive either. One employee an overnight employee definitely brings customer service down to a near bad review and was nearly tempted to put the place on a a negative social media blast as I felt, I was being targeted as someone by an employee who does not like me and I felt as if he did not appreciate my service as as a customer , and his customer service was very poor, and I felt like he was agitated by me every time I was around and wanted something like a drink or lay in the tanning bed or whatever.

This experience may come in the form of ordering a taxi, food for your meal or a rideshare car. \n\nAllegedly that's what lalamove tried to do. But while the App may look shiny and is considerably user friendly, it fails in all other aspects that may suggest a more automated or seamless experience. Some examples- why did I get 8 missed calls from their customer service after using their App? Why was I not able to resolve the issue after the 4 subsequent calls with their team? Why were there multiple drivers calling me? Why didn't the driver correct call me in the first place? Why was I negotiating with the driver til close to midnight on the phone? \n\nWhile training and basic customer service etiquette seemed utterly devoid from my interaction with the lalamove team, it seems the biggest shortfall is in how NOT streamlined the experience is. What should have been a 1 minute App experience turned into a combined 3 hour ordeal. I hope the lalamove team gets it and fixes their approach to their service, as well as reconsider the end users' journey post-click. It Best of luck.",

You can’t make changes nor can the movers once they have accepted a job. So you have to contact support to remove one guy, so it frees up the spot to find another helper. Would benefit from some gui/spatial changes to make it more user friendly and/or less intimidating overall.\n\nVisionary/executive/owner/coach?: Storyboard the entire application with branches of what goes to what storyboard. Then look at all your storyboards and redesign to cut the storyboards in half at least. \n\nThe idea is great, and has potential to grab a return and expanding customer base. You have to bring customer engagement down, simplify the order process. It needs to be as easy as Uber/Lyft. A metric to shoot for is easier than Ubereats, that app is still a convoluted mess in places to accommodate all the different restaurants and what have you. You’re defining the service/service level so you can trim and shape to simplify/make brainless easy.\n\n(AWS backend?)",

I contracted for 2 helpers, and 1 canceled at the last minute. The problem is: trying to get to a real person to get anything done didn’t happen. After Dylan, the helper that showed up tried contact you by phone, all we got was a voicemail. That doesn’t help me when I’m in need of a agreed second helper. Almost 3 hours later, you assigned another person, by it was too late. \n2. That being said, the guy that DID show up, Dylan was GREAT! Hard worker, and easy to get along with. I’m almost 68 years old, in decent health, but had I not been, this could have been a catastrophe. Too bad all your helpers aren’t as good as Dylan!",

So many of these programs do not require equipment OR I can use it at a gym using their equipment.\nI also dusted off my equipment at home, from my instructor days, so I can do Group Active and Group Power at home, where there are no facilities within a reasonable distance that offer these amazing Mossa programs. I do however miss the community you get in the live group fitness setting.\nThank you Mossa!",

Second, before the upgrade I could cast the video from my phone to a tv and see the video on both screens. This is very helpful so that my phone can be on the floor when I’m there for the workout. Now, the phone is blank. I contacted support and they said tough luck—it’s just the way the new app is designed.

When Xbox got rid of it I was at a loss, so I got in touch with MOSSA and they released the workouts via DVD first, then streaming. These workouts use the BEST music you will find. The workouts truly use the music - for example, with a punch or kick you might hear breaking glass. Or during weight lifting, they will time each lift to the beat but the beat is varied, like: 1,2,3 (pause) 4! (Repeat). Believe me you will want to turn up the volume and the time will fly! After 20 years it was great to learn some new MMA moves too, several actually. I also enjoy their Centergy series, it’s a mash up of yoga and Pilates, great balance work too. There is something for everyone: dance, yoga, weights, step, bike, HIIT, etc. They have 10 minute workouts that you can combine to get a variety, or just do when short on time. Most workouts are 30 minutes so you could do two different ones. And recently they’ve added 60 minute workouts. I’ve been streaming this for a few years, since they started it and each year we got new additions. The app always works for me via my Apple TV without issues unlike my other fitness program. I’ve never left an app review before but I figured it’s time for me to show my appreciation to MOSSA and try to spread the word. Amazing music, trainers and workouts.",

Ex.) 무리가 되면 취소를 해주세요 등.\n\n3. 최초 입력한 짐의 양이 변하지 않는다면 앱 하나로 기사님을 배정해주시고, 균일가로 운영되어 이쪽 저쪽 기사님을 일일이 알아보지 않아도 된다는 점은 정말 유용한 앱인 것 같습니다. 그러나 그만큼 예기치 못한 상황에 대비한 융통성이 갖춰지면 더욱 지속가능한 앱으로 발전할 수 있을 것 같습니다. 당일 이용하지 못하고 가신 기사님께 기름값 1만원을 생각해보면, 요구하실 수 있다고 생각하나 한편으로는 사전에 “밴이 제가 가진 짐을 수용할 수 있나요?”했을 때 가능하다고 하셨기에 믿고 진행했던 것이었습니다. 그동안 저와 연락하시고, 친절히 응대해주시고, 당일 급하게 시간을 앞당기는 등 죄송하고 감사한 마음에 요청하신 기름값을 드렸으나 이에 대한 혼란은 앱 사용에 대한 미숙함 때문이라고도 생각합니다. 결국 기사님도 저도 윈윈하지 못해버린 것이죠.\n\n이러한 융통적인 부분을 계속 개선해 나가신다면 더욱 발전하는 앱이 될 것 같습니다. 향후에도 이용할 수 있도록 개선되기를 바랍니다. 감사합니다.",

Missing information이 있으면 실제로 구매를 할 때 에러로 처리하며 입력하도록 하는 게 낫다고 생각합니다. \n\n이래저래 피드백을 꼭 드리고 싶었어서 장문으로 남겼지만, 저는 용달에 대한 진입 장벽 자체가 낮아지고(아저씨 대하는 거 무섭습니다ㅋㅋ), 간편해져서 정말 좋았어요. 좋은 서비스 만들어주셔서 감사합니다. 그리고 영어 패치가 완벽하지 않아 한글이 중간중간 나왔어도 영어가 지원되는 것도 좋았어요 :) 한글이 나온 부분들도 한국어로 적혀있어도 이해할만한 것들이었어요. 큼직큼직하게는 다 잘 되어 있었습니다. 서비스가 더 잘 성장하면 좋겠습니다!\n\n아, 기본 25000에서 자꾸 기사님들이 리퀘스트 일단 받고 취소하셔서 팁 포함 31200으로 올리고서야 확실한 게 잡혔고.. 이사하고서는 육만원 부르셔서 ㅠㅠ 조금 당황..",

The first time was great, because they came right away, moved the few items, and charged a small amount due to efficiency. The second time, the movers purposefully took the long way to the drop off spot to run up my tab, then they broke my dresser and lied about it. The third time, the movers arrived at the location at 12:11 to start the clock on their “labor minutes” but never called or messaged me. I opened the app and saw them driving away at 12:14. I called them, and they said they had to talk to police about a speeding ticket they received on the way over. Then they finally started work at 1pm, wasting 49 labor minutes at my expense, costing me an extra $112.70. I posted a 4 star review for the movers complaining about this and quickly got an email from Lugg explaining how they calculated their charges and making excuses. They finally issued me a refund of only $34.50, which is criminal activity. They owed me $112.70 and refused to make the adjustment despite having a full GPS tracking history of each of the vehicle’s movements as well as my communications with the Luggers.

      "text": "We are new to Lugg and we’re so excited to use what seemed to be such a cost effective and simple solution to such a common problem for so many people.  \n\nThe task was simple: pick up a bed from one house A, deliver to bedroom at house B. \n\n1) my husband and I have five children and were in between multiple locations so we carefully selected the only window of time the lugg app had available in order to accommodate the seller and to be available to be there to receive the bed.  We were supposed to get a call when Lugg was on their way to the pick up location (so I could then notify the seller of the item and try to get to the pick up location to inspect the item and handle any instructions.  We only got a call from Lugg driver once he had arrived at pick up location. \n\n2) when Lugg driver arrived at delivery location, he rang doorbell and indicated that the instructions only said to deliver the bed but didn’t say anything about taking the bed to the upstairs bedroom.  Since this is my first time using the app, I had no idea I had to he so specific about a bed delivery since I was paying for two guys, a delivery fee + a labor rate by the minute. Isn’t that supposed to cover the time the luggers are delivering your items to the appropriate place at your address?\n\n3)  They then asked us to pay them cash, “outside of Lugg” for having to carry the bed to a bedroom in the house.  Which, we did, hesitantly, since this whole situation started feeling sketchy but we were caught between a rock and hard place.  If we weren’t willing to give them the cash, what would have happened? Would they have just dumped the bed in our driveway in the rain/etc. and left it there?!?  We aren’t physically capable of carrying the bed from our driveway into the house which is the whole reason we used Lugg in the first place!!! \n\n4) Well, since we then had to go to atm to get them the cash they requested, they sat in the driveway in their truck and then when they had been paid and left the house, I get a notification from the app that the guys left the house and I was now being charged for 43 minutes of time they just sat there in their truck for cash!!! We got screwed and this is not right! I am furious and feel dooped.",

No discussion no investigation.. Believe me I’ve tried. I’ve even went a step further and equipped, myself with a body camera to have footage of these moves. Booked by Lugg and let me tell you bad bad bad unprofessional from beginning to end and I have the proof my profile will show you. I have over 100 moves, but one bad review due to Lugg telling individuals that we can do the impossible. Once again, I have proof screenshots of messages videos email sent. to Customer Service and let me tell you they do not care so don’t waste your time working or booking any moves to this company trash",

Like any other share economy service, the people doing the work are awesome, the people making the product are dropping the ball on the customers and their gig employees.\n\nFor some unknowable reason the platform will let you search the needed destination or service, and even offer suggestions on destinations and allow you to schedule, whether that location is open or not. And you as the customer are supposed to assume against the reason implied by being allowed to schedule for that place and time, that the destination may not be open and call to confirm before booking (which could also result in you losing the available booking time).\n\nIf the LUGG suggested destination isn’t open, you will have to find an alternate location or have the item returned to you - all of which incur continued per minute labor fee on top of the flat rate and labor fee being charged from the moment they left your pick up address. Preventable of the backend booking system actually spoke to the scheduling system OR a simple destructive action warning prior to booking something that is potentially closed.

The first time everything went so well hence I booked it second time however this time it turned out to be a huge disappointment. Here’s what happened I scheduled lugg for some reason they were not on time they were supposed to deliver it by 6 but they took one extra hour both drivers taking their own time. At first they arrived at pick up location late then what we scheduled took ample of time to load 4 mini wardrobe and took their sweet time to arrive at drop off location then they had this issue to find out the building it was so hard to coordinate with them as there was language barrier instead of hiring two luggers my partner had to help them to move stuff after all this they charged me $229 while I booked for $50 and now there is no one to help me with my concerns all I can do is talk to bot! Is this the way to help customers? The first time I booked lugg I had this giant cal mattress to be picked and drop and it was with one lugger I had no issues everything went so well and this time even after having two luggers this many issues I had to deal with top of that why should I pay unexpected amount for your staff mistake completely not acceptable. I need someone to answer my concerns just chatting with a bot won’t help. Please get back to me if you value your customers and their concerns please 🙏🏼",

They were so kind and efficient, and the whole process was much easier than I was anticipating. \n\nMoving used to be such a huge challenge - but the 21st century has brought us apps like Lugg to solve that problem! Super helpful. I’ll definitely use Lugg again in the future. So pleased with the whole process. Thank you Enghel & Edwin!!",

However, once approved to start getting work as a Lugger, I was twice in a row “confirmed” to work and then given zero work when each “confirmed” time slot rolled around. I was also given zero heads up that this would be the case from the support team. Please change the booking system for Lugger to only show availability associated with actual work for that times lot that you are displaying as “available”. The current booking system seems shady and I won’t reconsider becoming a Lugger again until I hear that they’ve updated the way their booking system works. Thanks!",

I thanked them profusely for accommodating and tipped significantly on the side as I felt they went above and beyond to accommodate me. They did not inform me that I was being charged by Lugg for the labor time. So a $70 quote ended up being over $440 after the extra tipping. I really wish they disclosed that I was being charged by the app. The changes are logical but it was very clear that I thought they were being helpful and was unaware of the additional charge structure beyond the initial quote. If Lugg could meet me somewhere in the middle by refunding some of the labor fees I would be very grateful and continue to use this app regularly, now that I understand how it works.",

To make matters worse, they took pillows that didn’t belong to me to help assist the move. It took about three days ago getting in touch with Alan just to get the pillows back. Lastly, I had asked them not to put the tonal on the floor because they could severely damage the Tonal. There was a table for them to put it on. I find that they put it in the second bedroom on the floor and now my Tonal won’t turn on. It’s already been two weeks since then and I’ve been reaching out to customer service and I haven’t gotten a response yet on anything.

THE MOVERS ON THIS APP ARE NOT VETTED OR ACCREDITED MOVERS, THESE GUYS DAMAGED A $7000 SOFA AND THEY ARE DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT!!!!! THESE GUYS ARE CONNIVING CON ARTISTS!!!!!!!!!!!!! When you read the lugg info page and request movers it says they bring straps, Dollies and protective gear. They did no such thing, two Joe schmo looking people showed up, retrieved the sofa and proceeded to literally launch it down my stairs, nearly killing themselves, they damaged my walls, they ripped the sofa, broke the frame. When we arrived to the storage unit the sofa was shoved around corners and literally forced through the door where two of the feet broke off and parts of the frame began splintering from the force at which it was shoved into the unit. I feel scammed, I feel defeated, and I’m utterly reeling over the entire experience. I feel like I just made the largest mistake of my life entrusting my items with this company and I wish I could rewind and take back every second of it.\n\nUpdate: Lugg got back to me with 2 options, the first was to keep the sofa and they would send me $400 to repair it. This sofa has extensive frame damage and the fabric is destroyed—a new slipcover costs nearly 2k and to have an 8-way hand tied sofa repaired also costs THOUSANDS what a joke!!!!!!! The second option was that I could dispose of the sofa and they’d send me 1400–BUT I apparently have to schedule the disposal through Lugg and find a dump site for the sofa. Boston doesn’t have public dump sites, we have to leave the furniture on the street and schedule a bulk pickup. Lugg said that this option isn’t feasible. I then asked Lugg if they can set up a junk removal service to come pick it up and they said no. So it really seems like Lugg doesn’t want to do the right thing and definitely isn’t taking any responsibility in their damaging my belongings. Would give 0 stars to this entire company, I hope it goes bankrupt",

I was floored… first they said it was the weight, then it was the 7 stairs, etc. I asked why this wasn’t explained when I included all the information. They said they didn’t even look at the dimensions, photo etc. until they arrived to pick it up. They also informed us that they didn’t have straps to tie it down. I’m not sure how they thought they were moving anything without straps or looking at the details of the move. I was looking forward to using them with all the great reviews, unfortunately it didn’t work out for us. Just caution if you need help moving appliances I would definitely go with another company",

They did not tell me that if they needed to drive to my storage unit more than one time, which was 1.5 miles away it would be considered another trip and I would need to rebook the van for $117! What a ripoff! \nHad I known, I would have paid better attention to how the van was being packed, as well as not given them all the little things and brought them myself. \nWhen I emailed the company, the reply was a link with “here it is in the terms of service” and no we are not refunding your money, you will pay for the van two times for each round trip 3 mile drive. What bad business! Ok, so maybe I should’ve known, and also maybe it would’ve been good customer service for Lugg to send me something that spelled out the terms of service. I received NOTHING from them. Also, it would have been nice for the movers to give me the heads up, “just so you know, if we make another trip, you will be charged for the moving van again!” Getting charged $117 again to go 3 miles round trip is nothing to say “oh well” over. I tipped the movers generously, over $100. To split. \nLugg sees nothing wrong with these charges. \nBeware! I will not be using them again. They are not keen on customer service at all!",

You can still pull people suddenly if you have to, but why can’t a customer try to help someone plan ahead and allow client and Lugger to communicate ahead of time?

      "text": "TLDR: avoid this company for it's pricing model. I was charged $700 for moving a studio apt furniture 7 blocks in Manhattan.\n\nI hired a Lugg XL to move my studio apartment furniture 7 blocks in Manhattan. the movers were not incentivized to work fast, so I worked alongside them as a 3rd member. they were nice guys but I had so many issues with my experience. \n\n1. Dont use Lugg for big moves.Lugg XL is not a moving truck, it's a sprinter van. My movers spent most of the time ($$$) deciding on how to fit my furniture.\n\n2. My furniture got damaged. I guess because I boxed everything up myself, they didn't bother to wrap my furniture with blankets. I ended up getting scratches on my tv stand, couch, and dining chair. \n\n3. Charging begins when their GPS says they are at pickup. But this doesn't take into account parking! My movers ate up 30 minutes just trying to settle parking even though it was indoor garage parking\n\n4. Predatory pricing model. Because of the pay-per-minute, I felt compelled to help out with the move to speed things along. I was the only one with a sense of urgency. God knows how long it would have taken without my hand. Honestly I didn't realize how screwed I got until the movers left and I got slapped with a fat bill. I literally just worked with them for several hours and then got handed a $700 bill and damaged furniture.\n\nThis is my first app store review and hopefully my last. Please avoid moving companies with this pricing model. Just do a flat fee and breathe easy.",

      "text": "On July 2, I had three sets of your employees perform unsatisfactory, disrespectful, end egregious behaviors. I first had Matthew and Tejas (in the morning). They could not fit a piece of furniture in the van, so they told me i had to hire an XL van instead—i booked Cally and Almir, who told me they needed two extra hands, so i booked Efosa and Greg (in the afternoon)\n\nI would like to file a formal complaint against these movers, and Greg in particular. I had an absolutely horrific experience with them—the highlights include: \n\n- damaged property (a wooden crate and barrel cabinet worth thousands of dollars; damage was to a door that was dropped against concrete steps in front of my building. I know for sure a Greg saw it break but he did not bring it to my attention. I pointed it out and all four movers acknowledged that that damage was caused by them) \n- more damaged property (a new pottery barn Mateo head board that was dropped by my first Luggers of the day and tore the wood straight off the upper corner. This occurred with Matthew and Tejas.) \n- terrible customer service (poor attitudes, lack of motivation, unnecessary commentary and verbal complaining, general laziness, and they were physically unable to do the job) \n- trespassing and unacceptable behavior (Greg was seen at the pick up location walking behind my mothers property. He returned after a minute or two and we assume he was urinating in our back yard)\n- excess charges (we were billed for them to sit around and wait in our front drive way for pick up while the other Lugg crew drove the larger van from over an hour away) \n- stolen property (a wooden $250 book shelf that was loaded onto Greg’s silver pick up truck. The shelf never made it to my apartment and i currently do no know it’s whereabouts. This is absolutely unacceptable and if it is not returned to me, I will have no choice but to file a police report for stolen property.)\n\nI am requesting a full refund for: Matthew and Tejas ($371 before tip, they did not complete the task requested and damaged furniture), Cally and Almir’s time ($365, they did not complete the task requested and damaged furniture), Efosa and Greg’s time ($301, they did not complete the task requested, damaged furniture, trespassed on my property, and stole a bookshelf), and reimbursement for all damaged and destroyed items. \n\nPlease respond to me at your earliest convenience. I have photo, emails, and contemporary documentation as evidence that i would be happy to share.",

      "text": "AVOID LUGG IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR HOME OR POSSESSIONS! Moving 1 bulky item up 1 flight of outside stairs...no pads or dolly despite my requesting it. Very inexperienced. They almost dropped my heavy item over handrail to pavement! Dropped item several times on ground and floor, bashed item against railings and doorway, worker (no gloves?) cut himself and bled on item and house. He had no first aid items in truck, luckily I did. Will take multiple sources and repair people to address more than $2K of damage to house and item - parts and labor for wood work, metal work, metal fabricating and plating, laminate repair, installation and painting. They expect me to find, call, get quotes from, hire and manage all of the people and get parts for repairs in a SF labor market and COVID supply chain where barely anyone returns calls. Spent hours getting verbal and texted estimates for $2K+ They offered me a refund of the $81 Lugg fee for the 30 minutes of destruction they caused. After I complained they offered another $300. If they want to cause all if this damage and make me do tons of work to get it fixed and pay for most of it, I'd rather write this review and warn others.",

Was hesitant at first but decided to give it a try. GLAD I DID!! Compared to traditional moving companies, they offer more flexibility in terms of time, cost. There’s no minimum hours, it all depends on how much stuff you have (price per minute). So it’s fair and reasonable. They’re also very on time. They let us know when the movers are on the way through messages and also update every progress through messages. Very transparent and innovative. The Lugg app is very nice, informative and easy to understand. \n\nMy stuff was moved safely and in good condition, no damage. They’re very dedicated when handling our fragile stuff. They deserve a good review and that’s why I did this here. \n\nI love Lugg and want to use and support Lugg. The product like Lugg is transforming the moving industry, making it more customer friendly, affordable and hi-tech.  \n\nPlease keep up the great work! I’m rooting for you!",

Lugg’s customer service is via email only. So it takes forever to get a response. The other team tried contacting customer service as well. Lugg finally got in touch and said that it’ll be 1hr wait for team 2. So team 1 is waiting and every minute is charged so charge services adds up. I ended up canceling order. The two gentlemen waited patiently and were great sports. My piano was never moved from my garage to my living room. I do not recommend Lugg for two team services (4 or more people).",

      "text": "Loggers came 20+ minutes late, yet it was counted towards my bill as extra $40+ dollars. Then they take their time moving and wrapping very slowly, much slower than the other moving services I used. I’m guessing it’s because the slower they are, the more labor minutes are counted, and the more they will earn. It’s like if Uber is charged by minutes and driver takes detour to get you there. It’s horrible experience watching them wrapping and inching slowly while I’m in a hurry to finish up moving and continue with my work. I even helped them move because they are so slow and I couldn’t stand it. Then I contacted Lugg support. And there was no response. I WILL NEVER USE LUGG AFTER THIS TIME.\n\nUpdate:\nCustomer support told me they refunded me 10 dollars for courtesy reason and claimed there is not wrong in their calculation that only 31 minutes were counted yet the app clearly shows 40+67 minutes were counted respectively at pickup and destination. After I responded that, customer support never care to respond again. What’s worse, I don’t even see that 10 dollars refunded in my bank. What a customer service I can only say.",

After waiting for 2 hours my movers showed up but they were nice enough to let me know that someone from Ikea was supposed to have all my stuff pulled aside and they weren’t even supposed to be talking to me, so it was a weird feeling to just leave my stuff with someone who wasn’t sure what to do with it.

Did not have ample protective materials for the sofa included in the job description\n3. Did not wear gloves or protect the fabric\n4. Removed the screen door that now doesn't slide\n5.

I have no doubt Lugg have great personality workers however there are many areas to improve and it’s really depend who comes to service on that day. In my opinion, I strongly suggest to have professional movers if you’re planning to relocate 1 bed room size furniture. The professional mover have 17 feet depth truck (vs Lugg’s XL Van-10 feet) and faster to make action which it will be much cheaper labor hours to have the best results for 100%.

Though not all driver but it Lugg who is to blame for not making transparency \n\nMy case load time was 3 min 46 seconds but I was charged for 15 minutes.\n\nAlways check time else you are being over charge for sure. I noticed this after 4 Lugg charging me more then I expected and then decided to track on 5th one...and I saw they over charged me for 15 minutes...and cold response on refund when asked on clarity\n\nDriver comes early you get charged but if they are late you won’t get compensation.

I love the variety of workouts to choose from…bag work, strength training, core, etc. My favorite is boxing and weights. I also love that they are always adding new varieties of workouts that are fun and challenging. I love that I can create playlists so at the beginning of the week I make a weekly folder with the workouts I want to do that week. Then I can always go back and see when I did the workouts.

The downsides - My app on Fire stick cuts out after 20 minutes every single time and I have to restart it, although luckily the video I’m watching picks back up at the same spot, and I wish there were more videos to choose from, although I notice they add a video about once per week, so that’s a start.",

      "text": "I used to live in Nashville, TN and was a long time member of a Title Boxing Club there. I got all the fundamentals down and was just obsessed with the workout. I moved to a small town and the closest TBC is probably 3 or so hours away. My gym has a punching bag so I tried to mimic the workouts but it was just never the same without a trainer shouting out the combos, etc. I recently downloaded this app and am so happy I did. For anyone who has the fundamentals down but doesn’t live near a TBC, I think this app is great! There are a lot of shadow boxing workouts but I just do the same combos on the heavy bag and it’s great. My only complains are that I wish there were more intermediate and advanced boxing workouts and I wish there were more 45 minute workouts or just 30 minute workouts with only boxing—no warm up or core. I find myself doing 2-3 of the 15 minute boxing workouts because I usually run or do my own warm up before I box and I wish they had more videos available with 8 rounds of boxing that I could just run straight through. I also wish more videos for boxing were updated more often. I feel like I repeat the same few every week. All in all, a pretty good option if you’ve got the fundamentals down but don’t live near a boxing gym.",

As the seller was moving, I needed to secure delivery quickly.  \n\nI found GoShare online. Its like Uber for deliveries.  \n\nUsing the app, i entered the pick up and delivery locations, details and a photo of the furniture. A driver picked up the job in less than 5 minutes. \n\nI received a text notification from GoShare letting me know the project had been assigned.  I had a few more details to relay. Jason replied quickly letting me know the information would be relayed to the driver. I was impressed that a real person handled the information.  \n\nThe delivery was successful. The driver communicated all steps of the project and delivered the furniture safely. \n\nUpon delivery, drivers mark the end of the project, and take a photo of the delivered item. This is saved in the app for your records.  \n\nThe app is easy to use, indicates progress, handles payment and tips efficiently.  Users can see an itemized break down of the final charges before paying.  \n\nThere is a charge if the delivery takes longer than expected.  My project did take longer as the driver encountered traffic. \n\nI was happy with my GoShare experience and will use the service again!",

I appreciate his time, and he answered all my questions as a first time customer. I wasn’t frustrated or got annoyed by him, sometimes it happens to new company.\n\nI told him I need a pickup at 4pm (when I called at 3pm) and he submitted that request in the database, however, this guy who decided pick up my delivery at Costco was commuting 1.25 hours away from MD to winchester so he arrived at 4:40pm. These drivers bring their own vehicles and maybe driving from somewhere far away or local so”can’t be accountable on exact time”. \n\nMy 2nd problem that I came across is that the white van that show up wasn’t a “cargo vehicle” that I reserved so the driver had to make 2 trips and was upset by that. What got to me is that the van was able to hold 2 boxes max -make 2trips-took more time waiting for him to drive back to my house and I was charged for a “cargo vehicle”! \n\nThere were some communication mistakes for sure! However I am thankful that someone was able to help me last minute today and show up less than 2 hours from when I made the reservation.",

I got a free estimate to see if I wanted to purchase (and by the way, the delivery fee rivals any store delivery fee), and done! The service was excellent.

My car was in the shop and I had so many things going on I couldn’t take his delivery to him. It was his wife’s Mother’s Day gift from the kids so it was imperative he got it today. I did a search online and scheduled my delivery. The gentleman that showed up was very kind and understood that it had to get to my sons house today. He drove it straight there. I am such a happy customer. I look like Mom of the year to my son and he looks like he did an amazing job getting her gift without her finding out. We all win",

      "text": "I wanted to share my experience and disappointment with this app. I placed a request a week in advance to move a treadmill. The request was for a pickup and helper. When the driver showed up to the address he stated the treadmill will need to be taken apart. I asked where the helper was and he said he is running late. The helper arrived an hour late. I helped the driver with the disassembly. Once apart I helped the driver with moving the pieces to his truck. Just to point out, I’m still recovering from major ankle surgery. The helper arrived when the last piece was being moved. I stil was needed to help as they were not able to lift the piece. When they arrived with the items to my home I simply said to just use the outside entrance to the basement, place the pieces inside and I will take of the rest. Again, I found myself being needed to help with lifting. The personnel that was tasked with the job knew ahead of time what they were moving. The customer should not be tasked with moving the items. Also I was charged overtime for the incompetence of the moving squad. I was offered a $20 discount. The overtime charge should have been waived due to the circumstances.If I did not help with the lifting I’m sure the charge would have been much higher. Will be using another platform for sure with the next project!",

      "title": "Great service, but the app",
      "text": "These are not personal issues, but general concerns that should be addressed for all users of the app and service. :\n\nThis is the big one:\nWhen making a reservation, pickup was at a location away from mine. So, I changed the address from my current location to the pickup location. Seeing that I missed entering the unit number,  I went back to add unit # to the address. At that point the app defaulted to change the pickup location to my personal physical location miles away from the actual intended pickup location. I almost didn’t see that it changed automatically.  \nThe app should not change the location that I had entered. The fact that I was in edit mode means that I was handling the addresses - don’t need it to revert to anything.  Perhaps there could be a <use current location> button instead if the intention is for the app o be helpful. Otherwise it’s the opposite of helpful. \n\nPerhaps the issue could be avoided if the unit number had available an “address line 2” instead of having to be input into the “special notes” or “additional info”  (how ever it’s worded).  My driver didn’t even see that it was in the notes because\n It wasn’t part of the address in the app. \n\nIf I didn’t see that I was reverted, driver would be at the wrong address and would likely cancel, therefor would cost extra, frustrate me and cause delays.\n\nSo, there are two things to change that are  critical to this app: \n1.) the app should not default to current location once a different location was already entered to change it from current location; and\n2.) An “address line 2” or unit number should be added to the pickup location.\n\nThe app has a glitch in the customer support portion (went to to a blank screen a couple times). \n\nFinally, There is no way to share the app from within the app. I needed to come back to the App Store to share it. Not convenient. If you seriously want us to share your app, then you should make it as easy as possible to do so.  \n\nYou alone have the power to make these changes. \nMake it so. It would be magnificent if the developers actually used the apps they develop. Don’t just go through it as if it was the real thing. Actually use the service. That’s how apps become great.",

Unfortunately, on his way back to my place, the weather decided not to cooperate.  I called him & he was willing to wait until the storm was over or keep my sofa until the morning.  He had excellent communication with me at all times and since the water was ankle high in front of my door, we decided to finish the next morning.  I was so impressed with his service.  It’s rare to find someone who goes the extra mile to make things work.  Stephen L. did that & more.  I will use GoShare in the future and ask for Stephen L. because I trust him with my purchases.",

Goshare provided cost estimate and move duration based on what was provided by us but the truck selected was very small.  Matter of fact the company did not have larger trucks to complete our move.  Since the company does not provide large truck, the driver had to make multiple trips to complete the move which took longer and ultimately increased our move cost significantly.  Instead of GoShare taking the responsibility for sending a small truck and absorbing the additional cost, they charged us for the mistake.   We will be challenging their cost.  Since they have no larger trucks, it tells me that the company is doing this intentionally to bump up their profit margins which should be an unethical practice.",

But the issue is that they don’t do this very well, I suspect because the company is weak and cannot control the “independent contractors” it is trying to connect to customers. My experience has been that I schedule a pick-up/drop-off with them on the app, which goes well and smoothly. Then, I get a barrage of text messages (why not use the app? Isn’t that the point of an App?) telling me about drivers rescheduling, cancelling, wrong size truck sizes arriving, and basically, a lot of your time being wasted and you realise that going to the local U-haul and hiring the couple of day workers there (actually the same guys who do the job anyway!) would have been quicker, less stressful, and easier. So, yes, it is trying to cater to our modern age of “faceless connections” and technology based basic services, but it miserably fails to do so. I am not sure why Uber works and GoShare doesn’t, but the facts lie before you.",

      "text": "The company responded to my request a short while after it was submitted. Two gentlemen contacted me from the store when they picked up my entertainment unit, brought it in the rain into my house quickly, carefully, and made sure to dry the top. They were incredibly careful and very respectful of my home. They took shoes off at the front door without me having to ask and carefully brought the unit into my basement. They made sure everything was set up correctly and other furniture moved away from the area and were a pleasure to deal with. They insisted that it had to be right before leaving. I was completely overwhelmed by their assistance having dealt with another company a month ago that was horrible.  I was overwhelmed by their professionalism , their consideration to make sure everything was to my satisfaction, and when people might give a  rating of “good” I think these two gentlemen were “outstanding”!\n I would never hesitate to have this delivery service again if I make another purchase at Home Goods.",

      "text": "I was referred to the GoShare app by the asst manager at our local HomeSense store to arrange delivery of two large living room chairs. The app is simple to use and we confirmed a next day delivery within minutes of setting up the app. My only complaint is the pricing - which was on the high side for the delivery of only two chairs in my opinion. However, timing was more important than money in this instance so I can’t complain too much. If I wasn’t under time pressure, it would have been less than half the price to simply rent a Home Depot truck for a couple of hours and do the delivery myself with a friend. I guess the old adage of “You pay for convenience” is certainly true for GoShare.",

The furniture came bundled directly from the store and was wrapped in plastic wrap. The movers brought a headboard and footboard up the stairs that was wrapped together instead of unwrapping it; bringing it up together made the items very heavy and bulky. The same was done for an armoire. Instead of unwrapping it and taking out the drawers to make it lighter they brought it up the stairs in tact with a very heavy dolly. The stairs walls were banged and scratched very heavily. The movers left all of the trash in the front yard. I was expecting professional movers. The movers were just unfamiliar with what they were doing it seemed like. They didn’t have moving apparatuses which make lifting heavy objects easy like straps. They didn’t seem very strong. I was really worried they were going to damage more than just the walls. I was worried they were going to damage the furniture or hurt themselves. I’ve moved a lot in my lifetime as I am a military spouse. I’ve never felt this uneasy about my items being moved. Only one person stayed behind to assemble a bed. I had to help the mover which was very uncomfortable. He did not know how to assemble the bed. I will not use the service again.",

If I could rate negative stars I would- one star is way too high. I scheduled a job to be delivered to my 2nd floor. They abandoned the furniture on my first floor. The movers dragged my furniture on the pavement with no protection damaging them. I had to send multiple messages to the company over days to actually get any kind of response re: completing the delivery and the damage. Response was akin to, first we don’t cover damage the movers do, then too bad we don’t agree our guys caused the damage so you’re on your own, and finally up to you to get your stuff upstairs too bad we couldn’t complete the project as agreed and scheduled. So here am I furniture blocking my enterance and damaged. Nice work GoShare- you should be proud. Never again will I use this absolutely awful service. Horriblr customer experience all around.",

I have receipts to prove I was overcharged but still it is unfortunate that this happened. The delivery went smooth but this billing is a nightmare. Don’t use this service they may be convenient but obviously they have hidden fees (They can’t explain them) and no one likes to use a service that is not upfront about cost. They have no customer service line to call, only chatbot so Goodluck getting in touch with a human about any concerns you have.",

      "text": "We scheduled a move for a Peloton exercise bike and 5 Boxes from Manhattan to Long Island. I booked this ~ 2weeks prior to the move. I was notified via the app that my one driver  and one helper were both confirmed. Out of an abundance of caution I reached out to the Driver 5 days prior to the scheduled pick up and found him to be pleasant and well informed. I reviewed the fact that the Peoloton would require two people as it will need to be taken up one flight of stairs and is very heavy. He confirmed that he understood. On the day of pickup I also texted the driver and got a friendly “ see you there”.  One hour prior to the scheduled pick up I received a call from Go Share customer support that they “can’t find a helper” and could the driver manage alone? I reminded them that the order is clearly visible to them and that it is impossible for any one Person to make the move. After many escalations and back and forth they asked to create a new  project and hope that a pickup could be arranged by 4pm that day. I had a larger move scheduled the next day so I had no flexibility. Meanwhile the original driver is texting me from downstairs a bit u certain of what he is supposed to do.  The experience overall was so stressful I would never do it again. This team has a long way to go to ensure that the coordination, communication and support measures in place really work to make it a reliable “small move” company. Of note the driver and helper who did end up coming were kind and hard working. The issue seems to be more structural and administrative. As of 7:30pm I am still waiting for a call from a manager that I was assured would\nHappen.",

The movers told me I wasn’t going to be charged anything other than the estimate. Additionally, they damaged my floor. They admitted to it.

They were courteous & professional, they got the job done quickly, & even removed the sofa from its packing box to get it in the front door. I am thrilled to know that any future needs can be met so quickly & securely by using GoShare!\nHighly recommended.",

Paid extra for a dolly and ramp. the driver arrived after transporting it from Arlington Va to DC on its side (a basic no-no). No dolly and no ramp. Pulled the refrigerator out of his pickup across his tailgate, dragged it across our cement stairs, then tried to place it on a small square wooden appliance buggy. \n\nAfter further scrapes and watching them try and lift it  damaging it more I had them leave it on my patio blocking access to my garage and alley. Nathan at GoShare tried to help and lined up someone for the next morning. \n\nThat person never called or showed. After talking with Brandi and Emilie trying to figure a plan that wasn't \"what's the latest we can take care of it\" and offering suggestions and options they could try, I was transferred to Marissa. She told me that they would not be refunding my original delivery or paying for someone to complete the job. When I told her that is not what Nathan indicated she disconnect our chat and blocked my ability to access customer service through the app. \n\nAfter being ghosted by Customer Service for 24 hours I paid some else else to move it in my house only to discover the transport damage rendered the unit inoperable. \n\nStill nothing on numerous texts or emails. \n\nBuyer beware!!",

I created an account, arranged for a pickup and delivery of my freezer.  I was quoted $54.95 for my delivery.  The CRAZY thing is that I did not authorize GoShare to hold anything from my bank account nor was I previously informed.  I have 2 transactions on my account... one for $100 and the other for $54.95.  Then they have the nerve to have these funds being held until Tuesday!  When a person does not agree to a hold on their bank account, or been advised of a hold on their account being put on their bank account, that can be considered as FRAUD.  \n\nI have made 3 attempts to reach customer service via email, but they haven’t responded to me at all.

It was not tall enough so the frige stayed on the dolly at an angle. I was not at the receiving end to inspect, but was originally told it arrived ok, so I gave them 5 star ratings. Later I learned the side of the frige was scratched in the transport. I noticed that the dolly/hand truck was smaller than a regular appliance size dolly (which I thought I had paid for). Also, I don’t believe it had anything to protect the metal from the appliance, thus the scratching. It was in excellent condition before this trip. I have seen pics of the scratches and they will have to be painted over. Had it not been for this damage I would highly recommend them. They should have used a professionally sized appliance dolly, like the one that delivered my new frige. This frige went to a friend and now I will try to cover up the ugly scratching as best I can. I can only recommend this service for items that are already worn or scratched.",

Put in info for an estimate ($10 more than ArtVan charged me- so knew it was in the ballpark) so I submitted request. Almost immediately my job got picked up. I called Corey who was assigned to me just to see if he needed any more info to get my order from distribution center. He asked me to text my invoice, and he was able to get my order no problem. Getting it in my house however, turned out to be quite a challenge! We had to take off doors, try several different angles, but they were pro’s and got it in!! I was very impressed with them and tipped their excellent service. The only surprise was that the job took quite a bit longer than original estimate, but with a good reason. I didn’t realize I had to finish the transaction online afterwards. I thought it got charged automatically. \n\nI would definitely use GoShare again!!!",

GoShare reviewed my competed and waiver request for the extra $100 in time charged and declined to do anything about it. So if hiring incompetent workers is your jam, GoShare may be for you. But if you, like me, thought when you pay someone $105 for 30 min of their time that they would be competent, then you should look elsewhere. Will not use again.",

Reviewing my account this evening, I was charged $373.76. I sent a message and received no response. I want my $133.08 that I was overcharged and I probably won’t be using this service again because of this dishonesty.

Enter GoShare, an app that is so easy to use and made this a breeze. My driver met me at Costco after I had paid for the vanity, and then his helper met us at my house. The two of them got this giant vanity into my house and up the stairs to the 2nd floor bathroom fairly quickly and without damaging any walls. All together, it costed about the same as if I had ordered the vanity on Costco.com with basic curbside delivery from FedEx. Totally worth the money, and would use GoShare again!",

      "text": "We booked Dolly several months in advance to help move items for our wedding. Although movers had been assigned well in advance, on the day of our wedding, we opened the app only to discover that they were no longer assigned, leaving us without anyone to assist with our move. Dolly never communicated this to us, leaving us completely in the dark even on the day of the event. When we contacted customer service, they informed us that while drivers may have been messaging us, no one was officially assigned. They blamed an automated system and claimed there was nothing they could do. Their “solution” was to suggest moving our scheduled time back a few hours, hoping it might get assigned. This made no sense—why would a few hours change anything after months of inaction? We explained that this was for our wedding and rescheduling wasn’t an option, but they offered no other alternatives. As a result, we spent the morning of our wedding frantically searching for other movers to transport our decor. It was an incredibly stressful experience and completely avoidable. Dolly’s service was absolutely unacceptable and added unnecessary chaos to what should have been a joyful day.",

I got a message at 6:30 in the morning that they were on their way almost there, and the business wasn’t open.) I could not reach anyone to talk to and the chat did not work at all. Additionally, the farmed out helpdesk in India (I believe) had rude personnel. I would not recommend this app until they clean things up.

The lead helper came alone because he wanted to keep the whole fee. He was small and weak and could not load or unload by himself.  And he did not want to use the moving blankets I brought or the tie downs. \n\nEven though he admitted he had no moving experience, he refused to follow instructions because “the man leads.” And th threatened “watch out or I’m gonna get angry with you” when I asked him to move his truck off the stone on my flower bed borders. \n\n It took a full hour and 45 minutes for him to load one buffet onto his truck. Then he drove 60+mph to the drop off and it took 45 more minutes for him to unload it and move it 14 feet - and he could not do it himself. \n\nDolly won’t respond to my request for a partial refund for the missing helper or address the helper’s threats or refusal to follow instructions. \n\nSkip the Dolly and save your money and your back.",

I called customer service and spoke with a representative who had difficulty communicating in English. He informed me that assistance was not coming at that time, and the next available opportunity for help would be at 7:30 PM or the following day. When I inquired about the likelihood of the movers actually showing up, he said I would know closer to the time. To avoid any uncertainty, I decided to reschedule for the next day. \n\nThe following day, I was expecting movers between 1:30 and 3:30 PM. At around 12:30 PM, I called to confirm their arrival and was told that no one had yet accepted the job, and I would receive an update by 3 PM. Given my tight timeline to move out, I was left anxious and uncertain about whether help would arrive. At 3 PM, I received an email stating that no movers had taken the job, and I would not be getting the assistance I needed. \n\nThis experience was extremely disappointing. The service was inadequate, and I cannot understand how a company like Dolly continues to operate when they fail to deliver on their promises. I will not be using their services again.",

      "title": "Worst moving experience",
      "text": "A horrible experience. When the first helper arrived, he informed us that he had not heard from the second helper after trying to reach him all day. He suggested we contact Dolly support to either cancel the move or see if they could send someone else. I attempted to call Dolly support 3 times without being able to speak with a human and opted in for a callback which was never received. Eventually we learned that the second helper was “30 minutes away” which turned into 90 minutes. My move was very time sensitive so myself and my injured family member were pressured into helping move items down the three flights of winding stairs which is why I hired moving help in the first place. Canceling this move was not an option. Because we could not move the large items without the second helper we spent over an hour just moving boxes closer to the truck which would then be moved into the truck later. The mover asked my family member to help him move a couch, knowing my family member had a back injury. When the second helper arrived almost two hours late, he was often on his phone and inexplicably left at one point for 15 minutes to move his car when my street had free parking. I hired a different moving company to unload, and when they opened the truck they were baffled at how poorly and inefficiently it was loaded. At least a dozen of my items were damaged, including an expensive coffee table I need to replace. When I did finally reach customer support, I did not have the option of speaking to a representative by phone but had to email. They informed me they do not cover damage to items for labor only blocks, so beware you could accrue hundreds or thousands of dollars in damage and Dolly doesn’t care. The second moving company recommended I ask for a refund based on how poorly this job was done and said if they had done this poorly they would offer a refund. Nick who I was emailing with from support was very unhelpful and unconcerned by how poor my entire experience went, and didn’t even acknowledge that my injured family member was asked to help move a couch by Dolly after we informed then he had a back injury. They also did not issue a refund and took days to get back to me after my first attempt at contacting them. Please stay far away from this company.",

Now here is the best part, the guy is oh let me take pics for insurance purposes lol, Dolly will cover $300 no matter how much damage these helpers do as they consider them contractors and are not liable for anything they do, got to love ! Now, we just moved into this brand new townhouse with $1900 worth of damage and they will only cover $300. Here is the kicker, on that day after the guys left to return the sectional to the store I get a call from Dolly wanting to charge me a additional $50 for them taking it back ( yeah I don’t think so ) and they charged me the full $203 for the service which is just crazy to me. So, $203 for service $1900 worth of damage and you will give $300 for it, so basically I got $100 towards the damage is the way I look at this. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE !!! YOU HAVE BEEN WORNED !!!",

At this point, customer service had to cancel my booking, and this was a huge inconvenience as I had already taken off of work that day for the move.

Which is a lie as I just finished reading the helpers handbook which I screen shot their internal policies to show the police when I get them involved tomorrow. The cost to move my item was 260. They canceled my trip not I. And the app charged me 520 dollars than because the crew said they weren’t getting paid I payed them again 250. Plus I had to hire three additional workers at a cost of 150 dollars because the criminals barely showed up with a dolly 1/2 the size of my own. So where am I at. It cost me 1000 dollars today to move an item roughly the same size as a refrigerator. I have asked to be refunded 520 dollars and was told no. This is a scam and 1000 dollars was stolen from me. They did deliver it but refused to even put it up right so I’ve had to do alone which I was able to do because I’m not an idiot. I’m livid with this experience and will report this as a theft to police. I screen shot everything which I suggest you do because they take away your access to the messages.

      "text": "I was excited that there was a company that could pick up items from stores that don’t offer that service.  I sadly received such poor service that I can’t recommend this company based on my experience.  The helper stated that he would arrive at the store at 4:30.   We had to call him after he was an over a hour late.  He arrived not dressed to move furniture in a dinner jacket and dress shoes.  The additional helper that we paid for  was not with him.  The store employees had to load the item which was very heavy.  Which I had provided a picture and stated that it was very heavy when I scheduled the pick up.  He also arrived with no equipment to move or secure anything.  He did not secure the item in his truck and once he arrived was unable to get it into the house.  Overall, a horrible experience and he charged extra to take the item off of his truck.  Long and short of my story, after paying almost paying $200 the item did not end up in the house and could have been damaged.  I would have been better renting a truck and having the workers load the item, which they did anyway.",

Assuming Dolly knew what they were doing, I thought this was enough space to fit everything.\n\nIt was not. Luckily, the helpers were able to take the big things (couch, dressers, entertainment center, desks, and large boxes). We had to take 3 trips with our car to get the rest of the items. \n\nI took a look at what is offered for a 3-bedroom option and it is also a box truck. If you have a lot of bigger furniture and boxes,  I recommend going with a different moving company.",

      "text": "I regret using Dolly and will NEVER use it again and tell everyone I know looking to move to avoid it. I had a last minute move to a new apartment and someone recommended this app. Going through the process to schedule someone was quick and easy. However, I had a terrible experience with the two helpers. They were poorly equipped with moving furniture. I was watching them the whole time and they were not careful with my items. One dropped a box of dishes. Same one had stacked way too many boxes on the trolley that were about to fall off when he went up a ramp, so I had to run over to tell him to stop and unload some of them. When I politely asked them to be more careful, they escalated it into an argument. They were constantly complaining and unprofessional. I paid and tipped them and tried to call it a day. However, it’s been two years and to this day I still feel upset over the experience. If you value your personal items, some of which are irreplaceable, hire an actual professional moving company than go through this app",

I asked the customer service woman if a mover would be assigned before my scheduled move and she just kept repeating herself “yes, no worries someone will be assigned before the scheduled time. Don’t worry”. After she said that multiple times, I asked her if it was a guarantee and she switched up and said “oh unfortunately it’s not a guarantee. But if that happens you can call us that day for a refund.” So - there was a reason to worry and a refund wasn’t going to help me move in time. My move out day comes, and still no one was assigned. I ended up having to come out of pocket and rent a moving truck and pay random people I found online to help me move. It wasn’t until the end of the day on my scheduled move that a customer service agent called me to tell me “unfortunately we weren’t able to find anyone to move you today” ….obviously. I looked up Dolly on Yelp and they have multiple accounts on Yelp for different cities - all under 2-star reviews. Thank god I found a last minute alternative solution or I would of been charged by my leasing company for staying past my move out date.

At 10:30 am a customer rep calls to inform me that the job cannot be completed in the time frame and that it will be delayed. I asked if there was a discount given the delay and he said no. Canceled it. Caused great inconvenience to both me and the lady whose home where the item was supposed to be picked up as we had rearranged our schedules to do thus. Utter waste of time and inconvenience and no apology for their inability to do this. Why promise a time frame if you can’t deliver? Your entire business model is built on that. This was my first time using them and definitely my last!",

      "text": "I have to be honest here, I am fighting an eviction process, I have a good case for a appeal, not being served correctly. \n\nI also have all of the rent owed stashed away in escrow because it was a bad error on their behalf, not a lack of funds. So after I was thrown out of my apartment, I had to leave all of my stuff in there, and I am now homeless. Today was the day that I got access to my stuff one last time. My grandmother came through and offered me some of what little money she had left in order for me to hire movers to help me out with the furniture I had left. We are not given a ton of time to accomplish this and after some back and forth between attorneys, I had just today to do it. \n\nI have AIDS, so I am not really strong enough to do this kind of work, and I literally risk dying to do it. Hiring Dolly, I don’t have any choice but to trust that they are competitive. I requested the Dolly help hours before I needed it, but nobody accepted it. I pushed it back as far as I could go, and I got a call from someone who wanted me to pay more money when they arrived, to come and help. I didn’t have any money to spare, so he didn’t accept. He offered to do it for the amount I paid in cash, if I cancelled it - but I knew that I would not be refunded for the service in time. I understand why he would do that but it felt like a bait and switch. \n\nNobody accepted, and I was stranded. I lost everything I owned, because I know that the attorney will not accept my request to come back. I am so distraught about this. If I had the strength to do it myself I would. Maybe they don’t pay the people enough. I don’t know. \n\nIt’s not Dolly’s fault that I lost everything, but I am incredibly disappointed in how badly the expectations are set in the app, how they take $600 dollars out of your pocket to “hold” your reservation with no guarantee that your going to be able to get help. And if you are limited on resources, your money is held up by the hold on your card and you can’t even pivot to something else. \n\nI have had only positive experiences with the competition - “Lugg,” so I am sad that I trusted Dolly this time. I liked the flat rate fee, even though it was higher than Lugg, but it made no difference because I was burned. Beware, you do not want to use them for big moves. Use Lugg instead. I don’t have the choice anymore.",

Therefore the order was canceled, but as I stated earlier, that cancellation was not noted in the app. when I asked to clear up the fraud situation, they said they could open a ticket and that the team responsible for clearing that up would be in contact with me. When I asked if that would be done today, they could not tell me or confirm that my order would be fulfilled in time. So I tried to cancel the order via the app and oddly enough, the app told me that it was in a “incorrect state”. I suspect that means that the system was flagging it is canceled, but the app wasn’t showing it as such. Overall, this was a bad user interface experience and an even worse customer service experience. I wasted four hours waiting on my order to be fulfilled.

If you have issues during the service you cannot get anyone on their support line, you can only leave messages. You have to email. I emailed the company and was told the service and charges would be cancelled. When the charges posted to my account, I contacted the company again and was told it was cancelled on their end and I would need to contact my bank if it’s showing a card. They then sent in fraudulent information to make bank saying the service was complete and that I never contacted customer service. They only sent part of the text conversation I had with the helper and cut off the part where I told him I was cancelling the service. When I went back to the app the whole thread was deleted.

The sellers disassembled the bed to help me “save money” with Dolly, so it was all ready to go when the movers arrived. Dolly added an extra $15 during the move because there was a flight of stairs at the seller’s house (even though the pieces were all disassembled, so the movers weren’t actually carrying any heavy objects down the stairs..)\n\nNo furniture pads were used, and they kept hitting the pieces on doors because they didn’t bring door stops. Normal, experienced movers always have furniture pads and door stops. One of the pieces got a nice big scratch in it.\n\nThis wonderful service cost me a cool $278. SO not worth it. Next time, I’ll be renting a U-haul.\n\nAdditionally, their app needs a lot of work. It won’t let you do anything else in the app until you answer their prompts, so I couldn’t do things like update my payment method or call customer service until I approved the $15 up  charge for the stairs.

Then left us in a state of confusion if he is showing up or not, we were very stressed since had to move out on the last day of our rental agreement. Anyhow, I called him and convinced him to show and I will pay them extra. The day of the move they both showed up, but nagging the whole time. The other mover smelled alcohol the whole time,  I think he was drinking whenever he had a chance since the whole six hours he smelled like alcohol.  Anyway, the moving was extremely stressful and I just was not able to get in touch with dolly customer service due to long wait time. Never use this service unless you want a great deal of stress in your moving day.",

      "text": "I used moving help only and the helpers were very nice. The main helper showed up just coming from the lake and was not happy to be working, but carried on anyway and was very nice. He was not dressed appropriately as he was in sandals and lake clothes. I thought everything went well as everything was being loaded into some U-Haul U-Boxes to be stored for a couple months. Come to find out when they were unloaded that there was damage to some of my belongings, not due to being transported to and from the U-Haul storage facility but due to the way they were handled by the moving helpers. As I was removing items I saw how things were placed in the U-Boxes and it was obvious to me there was no care taken in how my items were placed. Big example is that a 2 recliner couch was placed on top of my washing machine and the washing machine was broken due to the weight of the couch. I was furious and submitted a claim right away. After providing damage photos and even a photo of the one helper that was obviously still in lake mode the claim was denied due to liability coverage doesn’t apply to labor only moving help. I work in disputes and even my manager would have given an exception to that liability policy due to the circumstances. Just amazing how this company operates. It’s okay to have an employee who shows up to a job in lakeside clothing and shoes and destroy clients items and just wash their hands of it. I did look in my storage containers before I locked them to make sure everything was okay, but as my items were packed I wasn’t able to see certain things and missed the biggest problem that my couch was sitting onto my washer. I would never recommend this company to even my worst enemy.",

Before I was matched with a helper, someone named Daniel V. messaged me and just said “hi” with no further instructions. I was then matched with another helper, who I corresponded with but who had to cancel because he needed to pick up his kids. I was later paired with Daniel V., who I messaged with up until my move date and let him know I got a parking permit for his truck. The next day, when the movers were 30 minutes late, I called and messaged, and Daniel responded that he could not do the job unless Dolly adjusted his payout. I later learned that Dolly adjusted payouts for helpers because it was a busy time in my city, but I guess this helper wasn’t getting that. However, instead of contacting Dolly, he did not answer their calls or mine, and he did not cancel the job, which meant I couldn’t be matched with a new helper. PLUS Dolly support insisted that it was my fault that he didn’t show up because I had selected the wrong size vehicle. I had scheduled a pick up truck because I only had 3 larger items (not even a couch) and was only moving 2 blocks away. I was stranded on my moving day because this is a poorly run company that does not pay their helpers fairly, and the helpers are trying to get as many jobs as they can (understandably) and don’t have time to follow up with customers because they’re busy doing other jobs. They also have horrible BBB reviews. Take your money elsewhere.",

I make sure to set it a week out so the movers have enough time to view and accept the loads. Time after time, I have movers who will cancel same day after accepting a week in advance, costing me $400+ in commission each time. If you can’t handle the load, DON’T ACCEPT IT! It’s very frustrating and there’s usually no fixing once something goes wrong. And if there is a solution, it happens days later giving the opportunity for the customer to cancel or just flat out wasting their time. If you have something small, go for it; but if it’s any big item, I’d say stay far away from dolly. This business model doesn’t work if you can’t be on site to handle situations with thousands of dollars worth of furniture. Apple needs to take them down expeditiously.",

      "text": "I paid for 2 helpers only to load my truck (not unload), which is a minimum of 2 hours, $200. One of them showed up on time ready to work, the other one was about 45 minutes to an hour late and it just took an hour and a half total. My truck looked like they just threw my things in it, my leather chair was ripped, my new desk had black marks on the top that won’t come off, my relatively new couch, which was in excellent condition, is now torn in several spots and has black stains. I’m going to have to make another trip (5 hours away) to get the rest of my things because they didn’t load it properly and make it fit right. I used Dolly once before and the head helper was very good, made everything fit perfectly. I got the same size truck so it should’ve definitely fit! Since the assistant helper was so late, the head helper could only do so much, which I think played a big role in why my stuff was simply tossed in wherever. I’m beyond upset about this and I firmly believe I deserve at least a partial refund. I will NOT be using Dolly again!",

      "text": "I booked Dolly for a simple “labor only” move. All I needed was an extra pair of hands to bring the washer dryer down the steps. It turned out to be an absolute nightmare. I specific that we had one staircase and everything that would be needed to complete the jobs. All we got were two totally unprepared and careless kids who showed up TWO hours late and attempted to CARRY the washer dryer down the full staircase with no moving straps and damage everything on the way down. My walls, paint, stair railing and floors are all damaged due to the carelessness of these “helpers”, who actually did not help at all. Now Dolly has me submit all the photos and wait THIRTY days for a response to my damage claim. Oh, and they will not issue me a refund for this terrible job.",

The movers were 1) Late! and 2) LEFT A KING-SIZED HEADBOARD LOOSELY DANGLING FROM MY STAIRWELL!!! The claims group first said they would only reimburse approximately $400 for the bed and $500 for environmental damages. They wanted estimates which I obtained. The estimates to repair the damage to my floors, walls, ceiling and head board totaled over $9,000. Dolly then came back and said they would only reimburse $500 total for the damages despite additional insurance coverage I paid for. I paid $375 to move ONE bed and they caused thousands of dollars of damage to my property. \n\nThe movers refused to take the headboard over an outside railing to get it to a 2nd floor bedroom. Instead they insisted upon taking it up a rounded interior hallway that is too narrow. After they got the headboard STUCK they said they were too tired to try to move it anymore and had to leave it because they were late for another job! \n\nI had to PAY FULL PRICE FOR A SECOND MOVE IN ORDER TO GET THE HEADBOARD OUT OF MY STAIRWELL! The second movers came in the evening and didn’t want to assemble the bed even though it was clearly stated in the purchase order. \n\nThey said they were too tired and would have to come back the following day to assemble the bed. The next day, they couldn’t assemble the bed using basic nuts, washers, and bolts. They tried to steal the washers to cover up their errors. As I was questioning where the washers went and looking diligently on the floor, one of the movers dropped a washer from his pocket, as though I didn’t notice, and claimed it had been there the whole time. Then, the second movers WOULD NOT LEAVE MY HOME WITHOUT PAYMENT FOR TIP!! I paid an additional $60 to get them to leave without further damaging my property or harming me.",

      "text": "Do yourself a favor and DO NOT use this service for a move. I have never had a worse moving experience or a worse experience with the company after the fact.\n \nI cannot stress enough that EVERY SINGLE box I opened had broken items in it, the movers broke my bed, snapping the metal supports in half and they broke my window AC unit by causing a GIANT dent in the frame, so deep that the internal fan hits it when you turn the AC on. The movers were rude, inappropriate and took literally 0 care with my stuff.\n \nI live in NYC and was moving to another part of the city, not too far away. My old apartment was up two flights of stairs and the second was one flight of stairs. Just want to put into perspective that this was not a difficult move, I was not going very far and the movers/helpers did not have to go up 5 flights of stairs. \n \nIts no exaggeration that every single box I opened had broken items in it. I’ve done big moves, from FL to NYC, NYC to DC, DC to NYC and within NYC. I’ve moved myself, hired other movers and had friends help in the past. I have NEVER had a worse moving experience, and I moved right after a blizzard before (trust me, I had no choice and it was awful). NEVER in my life, have I seen so many broken items, never. \n \nEvery box I opened had more and more broken stuff in there. I don’t mean chips, or a scuff, I mean hard metal items totally damaged, with metal pieces concaved in on themselves, glasses broken, standing fans totally broken, even my bookcase, that had a metal frame and is mountable to the wall is broken. The metal is so far bent that it cannot even stand up straight and no amount of effort seems to help get it back in alignment. \n \nAll of this is upsetting on its own, then comes my experience after the fact. I paid for extra insurance “just in case” – so I was covered up to $2,500 for related damages. The total amount of damages was well over $3,000. Dolly, after weeks of back and forth, me sending pictures of all the damage, receipts showing the cost of the items and providing an itemized list of the damaged items, along with their prices, Dolly finally tells me how much they’re prepared to offer me. $291. \n \nLet me say that again, Dolly offered me $291, less than 10% of the actual value of the total value for items like my bed, where the frame was literally broken in half and AC unit, which was so damaged that the internal fan scrapes against the exterior metal frame were not covered because they were considered  to be  \"regular moving wear and tear such as minor dents, stains or scratches.\"\n \nI am in the process of trying to get more money through my insurance claim, but I’m on day 2 of no response from Dolly. Do yourself the ultimate favor and never use this moving company. I understand that not all moves will be like this and other movers may be better, but in case something does go wrong, like what happened with me, Dolly will do absolutely nothing to help you.",

Found them through a referral from a friend, and have already used them twice this week. Both times were custom moves with moving parts, changing addresses and delays, and they were amazingly professional, patient and fun to be around! Jonathan is my favorite mover — book him! He’s smart & handy! I felt very taken care of throughout the entire process for both bookings (and did I mention the second booking was reserved in less than 12 hours notice and they showed up and did such an amazing job!). Don’t delay or bother to price check them against competitors. You’ll win hand over fist with them everytime. Thanks Rico & Jonathan!! 💯✨",

If I need gas midweek, I just hit the buttons and when I come out of work on the scheduled day, my gas tank is full. I have severe asthma and standing in the Michigan winters, windy days, or humidity, makes my chest tight and I’m thankful. I no longer have to stand at a gas station at night (and worry because my city isn’t safe) because I planned on getting gas before work and then was running late. I’m a procrastinator and it’s so nice. \nThey average prices. So you get the best. \nThey do upgrade stuff. Fluids and other things like wipers. \nI was off work for a few weeks and I just hit the “skip fill up” button and it was easy peasy. Every time I’ve they text me the reminder that they’re filling my car up, and had I’ve had to text them back, they’ve always answered promptly and very kind. \nI honestly think, unless you enjoy going to the gas station for fountain drinks, this eliminates the gas station all together. \nThey send you a reminder \nThey fill up your gas \nThey text you a picture afterwards with the amount of gallons \nThen they send you an email receipt \n(that tells you all the local gas station prices within a certain mile radius). \nI’m going to schedule my daughters car too because she runs out of gas constantly and it’s super annoying. I think it’s great for anyone, but especially ppl who can’t stand to stand in extreme weather, disabled, elderly, or forgetful spoiled children. \nI’ve never had an upgrade so idk about that but the only thing I do is make sure my gas tank is unlocked and let the magical wizardry that is Yoshi do it’s thing. 👑",

And they even come early in the morning between 4 and 9 if you want, so when they do my gas (and anything else) between 4 and 8, it’s all done before I have to head off to the office.\n\nThe customer service is very easy to reach too, just a text message away. If there’s an issue pumping your car or doing some other service, they’ll text you right away and give you a few minutes to fix the issue if needed.\n\nI’ve had issues with some of the sub-services like not pumping my tires full of air when I asked, but all in all, it largely works. And when they didn’t do the service, they refunded me that additional fee quickly.\n\nObviously if you don’t drive very much or have a very short commute, this app really isn’t for you.

After realizing the service have not been rendered, I reach out to them and ask, if they are running late and forgot to notify me? \nAll I get is sorry would you like to reschedule? \nI did, didn’t think much of it but was upset with the fact that I scheduled my service around my work schedule and lunch time. Now I received an email yesterday stating that effective Yesterday evening they will place a hold on my card for $60 and if there’s a fund it will take 2-3 days to get it back. \nOkay, but you’re informing the customer of this change not a month a head or even a week a head. Your information them that this became affective the day before they even receive the email or notice. Although not my case, but I understand some people don’t pay their bills or cards get cancelled or maxed I don’t know what the case is, but customers should at least get more time notice of such changes. \nWhat will change next?

To be honest they have horrible customer service and hardly show on time in the 4 hour gap they make you wait. Sometimes they even cancel on you saying that they can’t make it when you have been waiting during those 4 hours for them to fill up your car. Literally I have been paying for a service that I have not be able to use since they keep on canceling when they are not responsible and negligent. Just recently they accused my account of fraud (out of the blue) with out telling me. I tried to make an appointment for a fill up and it didn’t work and thought it was a glitch. I trying contacting them and still never got a reply. I had to go all the way to their website to try and find their email to contact them and after I told them I was having issues with my account they told me they flagged my account and canceled it claiming it was fraudulent. They claimed I had too many cars and addresses being put on the account. Hello, my car does not only go home- if I have more than one car I should be able to use it. If I have a rental car I should be able to use it. If my car is in a different location I should be able to use it. As long as my credit card is not being declined or being back charged claiming it’s fraud what can you say is fraudulent. Better of getting gas myself and not have to waste all my time waiting for them. They made me late to work several times and cost me money!",

She got her gas parked next to me but mine got cancelled because of their bs reasons. This is a waste of time, my cars been low on gas and their customer service rep is no help at all. I will be requesting my money back for the member ship fee. This app is only good for a 2 time use during trial. Don't waste your money on keeping the member ship.

Man, so my first fill up was miraculous to say the least. After canceling 4 days in a row, I guess somebody just accepted my order. Fast forward a week later and my husband needed to fill his car up, I mention them hoping they’d might respond faster, but sure enough. They didn’t! Having canceled literally 4 days in a row again. On the day it finally was scheduled , they texted me saying referral abuse and I’d be charged a delivery fee for services I did not receive. Me and my husband have 2 different cars in the same household. So they cancelled his account.  This by far have been the worst subscription I have ever been signed up for.

I got that fabulous text from Yoshi in the morning saying my truck has now been scheduled for today. So you know they have this promotion going on where you use a recommendation code you get your tank for 99c. Who doesn’t want that!? On my time window it said estimated time arrival from 9:30 to 11:30 pm. They were not showing up so my ETA started going higher and higher and higher until it said they were late so I waited one more hour and nothing. So I cancelled told them their UNRELIABLE.

Understandable). On my \"Yoshi day\", I checked the app for any and all updates regarding the service.\n\nFirst problem: When I checked the app, it had said that the ETA would be between 4:08pm and 4:38pm, which was SEVERAL HOURS past the time slot I had originally signed up for. The reason why I signed up for a 9am-1pm slot is because I had other things to do in another city. Yoshi lets you change your parking location only within a certain radius of your originally-scheduled location. Anything outside of that specified radius, and you'll have to change your delivery time and/or date. At that point, it started to feel like they were expecting me to waste my entire day and wait around for them. Very unprofessional.\n\nSecond problem: Not only did they totally disregard my allotted time slot, but that ETA kept getting later and later as the day went on. By around 3pm, their ETA had updated to around 6:30pm at the latest. \n\nThird problem: One of Yoshi's customer service reps reached out to me via text at 5:14pm saying that they won't be able to get to my car due to delays, commented that they are working on adding more fuel tech to my area, added a $10 credit to my account thinking that would make up for the sub-par service I experienced, and then canceled my service for the day.\n\nI totally understand that delays happen. However, why was I contacted so late in the day? Yoshi's operating hours are from 9am to 5pm. They had PLENTY of time to let me know that they wouldn't be able to get to my car, and schedule me for another day. I would have been okay with AT LEAST that. Again, they contacted me at 5:14, which is after they have concluded operations for the day. That's totally unprofessional, and quite frankly, a bit disrespectful. \n\nI appreciate the credit added to my account, but that hardly makes up for what I have experienced today. I have scheduled yet another gas service for tomorrow. How that goes will determine whether or not I continue using this app. For now, I feel this 1-star review is very well-earned, and I can't say that I will be recommending this service to any of my friends or family.",

It’s nice not having to worry about filling up my gas, especially on those days when I’m about to hit empty and don’t have time to go to the gas station. The app is straight forward and easy to use. They even have someone dedicated to sending you text reminders that Yoshi is on their way for your services or if you just have questions you can talk to them directly. They text you once the service is complete and email you a receipt right after. I also like that they’re good about the time frames you give them and are punctual.\n\nThe only thing I wish they had on the app was access to receipts/charges.",

Car was dirty on the outside, and needed to be washed on !OUTSIDE ONLY! and they asked for more money saying that it took them more than usual 30 minutes, but on a app it’s saying to allow 1 hour! \nThe car is still DIRTY! Customer service never got back to me on this issue, paid $49 for nothing. I should have gone to real car wash for $37 they would leak my car clean inside and out at no additional charge",

Now let's say you fill up every two weeks and your car holds 20 gallons. At $2.85 a gallon, it would cost you $57. With Yoshi, it would cost $61. If you're a weekly filler, that's about $100 a year. If you're a biweekly filler, it's $104. Now if you're like me and you have a motorcycle that needs to be filled up every 2 days, that's an extra $100 a year.

I scheduled my first order since they promised 99 cents per gallon (how can you refuse?) so I requested for them to be here in the morning (9 am to 1 pm). Being this said I stayed at home the whole time and the truck came near my house but never filled up my car’s tank and left. Now I contact customer service (“Rachel”) and she says that the car has been filled up using the 99 cents promo on another account so this fill up will be full price and I don’t even have another freaking account! So basically they’re saying I’m crazy. They play with your time, your money and your sanity.",

I woke up the next day and got a text at 4 am telling me my service was cancelled because they couldn’t find my car. If they couldn’t find my car, why was I not called? My car was right in front of them, I parked it right outside my place. They have my number for a reason. I tried to get it rescheduled but everything was booked so instead I ended up just getting my tank filled up and now about to drive to Jifffy Lube to get an oil change. The fact that I wasn’t notified until the next day and that they weren’t able to give me a new appointment because they were too lazy to call, really makes me upset with this service.

      "text": "So before you get started let me lay down some basic math for you. First off you have to pay a membership fee of $20 a month (which they give a free month when you sign up). The membership fee comes out to be about $0.65 a day(for a full year). The gas you can chose from is regular or premium unleaded. I chose regular which was $2.68 at the time. The current price of regular unleaded in my area is around $2.40, mid grade $2.64, and premium is $2.89. You only “save money” on gas when you order extra services. They didn’t list the price of the services but showed how much you would save on gas. At the end of the day you are paying roughly $0.65 a day for a membership, then you add up the price of gas plus any extra services. Now with the extra services you add you will save money on gas alone, but you need to add up how many days you go with out filling up. I.E. you go 5 days without filling up $0.65*5=$3.25 plus add on the gas $2.68*gallons, then add the extra services then minus the discount they give you. I believe the highest discount I saw was $1.00 for an oil change. To me this is a complete rip off. You’re not going to save any money and in reality you are going to spend a lot more money. I just hate when companies say their users “save” X amount of money, when they actually end up spending more money. I understand it’s a delivery system which I expected the gas prices to be a little higher but I did not expect a membership fee, and when you add that membership fee into the price of the gas it’s outrageously expensive. Maybe if they got rid of the membership fee or lowered it, it would be worth it.",

      "text": "Last week my wife took my truck to work. Neither one of us realized that it was low on fuel and she was going to be working super late and most gas stations are closed by a certain time. I downloaded the app trying to figure out something for my wife. Within a few minutes I got a text from Rachel saying that if I had any questions or needed anything, she would be glad to help. I explained my situation and she immediately reached out to one of her drivers in the area to see if it was a possibility. I was concerned about her being parked in a restricted garage, that they would not be able to get to it. Initially they said they didn’t think it would work and we could have ended the conversation there and I would have been extremely pleased with the customer service provided because they tried to help in such short notice. But Rachel text me a few moments later and said if someone could give them access, it would be no problem and they made it happen same night. I could not be happier with this service. Highly recommend.",

Off putting to me.  Looks amateurish.\n\nThen the service: only do a weekly or twice a week, I don't need that much. Also my work parking lot is big and gets busy, so how will they figure out where my car is? Are they going to need me to come down and show them? \nPrice: no mention of delivery or service fee. If there is none they should advertise that because that's the only major problem I have with the concept. Other similar service (with better app) do charge $3, which is about 8% for a fillup.

I drive with GoShare and my payment can never be tracked by me, the payment method is very ridiculous and it’s not transparent. Sometimes, some payments will be added together without indicating what project it was by adding project numbers, which makes it very difficult for me as a driver to track my payment as they are paid out to me. Some payments will be paid alone, sometimes payments will be paid randomly by picking one from the top and leave like 2 in the middle unpaid and one will also be paid from the bottom and this makes me lose track of my payments as a driver. This payment method is not transparent and it’s a very bad style because sometimes some of my payments are never even paid. GoShare should try to be more transparent concerning payment and make it trackable for drivers also. This will make everyone happy.",

I can get my own background check done for free that meets all state and federal requirements. \n\nAny company that requires you to pay for your own background check, whether you’re an independent contractor or not, should be approached with caution. It makes no sense to require an out of pocket expense from someone when they don’t even know if they’ll have available projects in their area. \n\nIf you’re looking to make some extra cash, I’d advise not moving forward with this one — at least not until they waive the background check fee.",

      "text": "Dallas/Fort Worth area courier.\nI would like to tell abit about my personal experience with the GoShare. When I registered there was no orders almost ever, that was especially said because I had to pay $150 for my background check(you have to pay for BC but not everybody pays $150 only those who ever lived in NY). So it’s not a reliable income not even supplement. 2-3 months later business picked up a little, there is one company that sends orders ones a day on the first come first served basis. So I got my first order but when I arrived and waited in line for about 30 min(the whole thing took about an hour) the guy in charge said he doesn’t have my order in the system. Also you are independent contractor so no body will compensate you for time, gas, etc. To summarize \n1. Not enough orders and compensation is not grate to say the least \n2. Long wait time at the pick up location plus you might not even get your order.\n3. Lack of item description usually it’s something like 1-gag mag dag 3pc 46?)8’frtu, that’s your description, I just never know if it is going to fit in my car:)\n3. People at the pick up are poorly organized, to them you just a nuisance.\n4. Orders usually have to be picked up at certain time which means you have to be close which means more unpaid time waiting in the area.\n5. GoShare is not transparent about earnings in specific areas\nBig plus to GoShare support team, they respond really fast. \nI wouldn’t recommend unless you are traveling the same way as the package and you can allocate the time, again this is courier experience(cars/small cars).",

That’s why is required to have a credit card on file when you submit the application to work for then.\nThat’s my story with this guys , they charge me to my credit card for something I never did it and 2 years later COLLECTION company’s star calling me to say I OWN MONEY for a “damage” project.\nBE CAREFUL !!",

Customer service is very responsive and very helpful. Payments have been quick and estimated job payments have been accurate.  The only challenge is beating out the competition for jobs, since it’s first-come, first-serve. Got to be quick, responding to notifications!  What an excellent system too!  Using a smart phone, an app, and my truck to make money.  My Apple Watch is also a very useful part of the technology.

They make you acknowledge accept many things..first drivers can not be late for pickup if it’s more than 15minutes late and if the customer complain they keep track of it, after you make $$in thousands few months later they would take money from your credit card without your authorization because you already authorized them on the credit card before. I think only thieves would do that. They have only ladies handling the accounting department and those ladies have no mercy they are rude, they don’t talk to you…they charge your credit card for penalty for showing up and e-mail you the receipt for the amount took. If the driver cancel the pickup for some reason and becomes more than their limit they charge you penalty and take money …they have only chat window sometimes nobody would respond for hours…no one will talk to you one on one when you are in need, if they need to talk to you they will and they expect you to answer the phone., that is slavery. Basically they treat drivers like trash. Sometimes they have long haul deliveries for solar companies, they pay only one way tolls and they don’t pay tolls for you coming home if it’s longer than 8hr drive they don’t pay for hotel stay, they expect you drive back immediately or don’t care if you drive immediately….that makes 16hrs of driving which is not allowed. All other apps like this give Deadhead ($ per mile) to comeback home after drop off. This GoShare doesn’t give you a penny not even tolls to come back…instead they take money from your credit card without your authorization….be careful of this scams.",

There is nothing wrong with outsourcing your delivery vans. But these yahoos do not want anyone who doesn’t have their own van. I don’t have to have my own personal insurance on the cargo vans that I rent. That is covered by the company. It is unfortunate that we were not able to work with this company but considering the absolute hypocrisy of saying use the cargo van. And they don’t want to hire you. It’s obvious from my standpoint that this is most likely fraudulent company. I will not ever ever use the service. For my own deliveries to be made or vice versa. And I will tell all my drivers to not use the service. It is unfortunate but I would strongly recommend Apple remove this service from their platform. Delivery drivers should be allowed the option to outsource their delivery vans and rent them if need be without having to provide all kinds of proof. I do all the background checks on my drivers. Do not use this service stay away it is obvious they are only wanting to rip people off. I cannot abide by fraudulent companies saying one thing and then doing a complete 180 on another. In business you have to be honest and forthcoming and you cannot be discriminatory on who you hire. I recommend the federal government checking in on this as well. It’s a real shame good concept too bad it’s run by a bunch of fraudulent scammers.",

That’s a cost of doing business that should fall on the company, definitely not the contractor. No other app or company has ever asked me to pay for a background fee. \n- They charge a cancellation fee to drivers ranging from $10-50. How ridiculous. Their video tries to explain how it is not a punishment but there’s no going around it. Your parent/spouse/child suddenly in the hospital? Pay up. You get in a car accident? Pay up. \n- To move on with the onboarding process you half to watch a HALF HOUR LONG video that explains nothing but common sense, and about 7 minutes explaining the clumsy flow of this app. AND THEN you have to answer a 41, forty one, question quiz on the video. It’s easier to sign up to deliver people (which doesn’t say anything good about uber or Lyft either 😂)\n\nThere’s better apps and services to use.

Work was slow in the beginning but it has gradually picked up. I’ve completed (2) jobs but have had multiple ones slip by or sometime rejected. The platform is easy to use. You have to be quick sometimes when accepting a job or someone else will grab it🤨. Had an issue with pay but once I contacted GoShare , it was dealt with quickly! I’m making about $40 on a job but it’s a start and I’m loving!😊",

I’ve been a driver and a costumer and had problems in both ends, wondering if they’re following the real law. Or if they have their own law. \nMy friend who’s a driver told me he hasn’t been paid few rides for over 6months. Also he said he had an accident and they charged the costs all on him.

For some reason I am not getting requests to my app. I only receive emails which I reply with the word “accept”, but most times, nothing happens. I deleted the app and downloaded it again and it is the same thing. I borrowed a friends phone and downloaded the app on his phone and I was able then, through her phone, to accept the 1 job I have been able to do. I triple checked and my phone have push notifications activated. I don’t know what seems to be the problem, and I have only been able to communicate via text messages with your support team. \nJust right now I received an email with a project but nothing on the app! This is very frustrating! As of right now, I am in the negative with GoShare. I haven’t been able to even recuperate the cost of the background check. I will really appreciate some technical support with this app. I have friends that have trucks and were all waiting to see what was my experience, to see if it was worth it before they move forward or pay the background check. As of right now, my experience has been very frustrating and disappointing. Please, I need some technical support. Thanks in advance.",

In my particular city there is a great cultural and language barrier which prevents the driver from even being friendly. I’ve personally watched my ride arrive after an hour only to speed off in front of me to do random new pickup requests. Yes, the app lets you monitor all of this including your drivers location. Occasionally Drivers will even mark you as picked up when you are not, they will check off they have arrived at the location when they haven’t. I’ve gotten into cars that are filthy, with no seats, etc. They need a more serious background check to who they are hiring, many of the drivers are unfamiliar with the area, pooor driving skills, driving barefoot, rude, etc.",

They’ll drive you around the whole city before it gets to your destination. You would think the routes correlate with the riders’ drop offs, and they USED to, but not anymore. This happened directly after riders took surveys. At the end of the day, the timing doesn’t bother me. You don’t order a via if you’re in a rush or trying to get somewhere in a timely manner. The only thing that’s convenient about it anymore is the price. That’s the only reason I continue to use it. I hope they fix it.",

Some of them are great but far too many are downright scary to drive with. It’s a crap shoot as to whether my 12 minute ride will be a roller coaster or a chauffeured limo where I’m not holding on and hoping we don’t hit another car. Also, the wait times are awful. They say you’ll be picked up within 15 minutes on average, but it’s more like 40 minutes and that’s if you don’t get bumped to another vehicle which delays your trip or you get a text saying your driver is delayed and it tells you to cancel your ride if like. As I said, the concept is great but the transit needs to go in house or hire another company who can do it better and with integrity.",

Firstly I couldn’t get any rides but somehow other people were getting picked up in via cars in front of me at the bus stop, so there couldn’t have been no rides available in the area when I saw plenty. Then I finally got a ride after 15 minutes of repeatedly tapping the retry button, but it seemed that the driver kept getting farther away from where I was and stopped moving for several minutes, then just when the ride was 8 minutes away from me, it got cancelled. So I frustratedly tried to get another one and each time I saw one available somehow the seat got taken, this happened over 7 times, I eventually got on a bus because the app kept saying it couldn’t find any available rides and when it did, someone apparently took it 1.5 seconds after it appeared for me. I would rate this app zero stars if I could. Very disappointed, I was recommended to try this app because it was more affordable than lyft and uber, but I’d rather take those than ever try this again, waste of time (literally). Don’t try via if you have to be somewhere important at a certain time. Thankfully I didn’t try this to get to work.",

There have been at least four times that I clearly remember where I ordered a ride and then the driver starts going the other way. \n\nToday I used Via. There was a 20 minute wait. It took 30 minutes. When the driver picked me and another passenger up, the navigation had us going in circles. We were able to figure it out on our own. We added another passenger in the small SUV. With the SUV already full, the driver got another request. On my ride alone, she had to be on the phone with VIA support twice. \n\nI don’t think these are an anomaly but more systematic issues. \n\nI do sometimes get drivers who hand hold their phones while navigating. All Via drivers should have phone mount devices.",

EASY. ive been picked up here a billion times. but after standing and waiting for 20 minutes, the via is near my school im happy but then they continue to go the wrong way TWICE. they need people who can actually use their gps and maps because i swear its not that hard. thought this was gonna be a cheap and convincing way to get from point a to point b but this app is so inaccurate that it hurts. they never drop me off exactly where i need them to. they've dropped me off in front of random peoples houses down the street from my house on multiple occasions. i rather spend an extra $5 for a uber if it means i get a better experience through a rideshare and thats that.",

Then my 2nd issue, which is even bigger is……….I left my wallet in one of the Viacles (didn’t have money in it at all)………..but now it’s gone. What’s worse is that I called them for so many days and talked to so many different people just to eventually find out that my wallet wasn’t it their vicinity anymore (they customer service got extremely tedious after a while, so I tell you, PLEASE DO NOT EVER forget to turn around and check the seat before you leave the vehicle, PLEASE, because it is not worth not looking. It was my fault of course, but honestly, they could’ve helped me out and got it back to me). Oh and p.s. if you lost something, don’t try to email them, because they likely won’t respond at all.",

I literally called friends to call rides for me to avoid using this app because it’s just disappointing and makes me late for everything. Calling a ride takes forever as you go through the process of putting in your addresses for it to tell you they’re too busy and make you start all over. Why can’t you just leave the addresses in and let me try again? \n\nFor a shared ride, these are way more expensive, longer waits, and less available than private rides. Living in DC, a super active city, it’s a hassle to have to wait 20-25 min for each ride and then have to walk to meet them. There’s also the safety issue of catching them at night. As a young female living in the city, it’s not cool to have to walk 4 blocks at 2 am after a long night out. \n\nIn Summary, this app needs:\nMore drivers\nCloser meeting/dropoff spots\nDoor dropoff for late night rides\nShorter pickup times \nCheaper shared rides\nMore convenient interface",

      "text": "This company is a scam and I DO NOT recommend. As we all know, you are required to have one card on file at all times with your account. Sounds normal right? No problem at all.\n\nThe issue comes in with Via not allowing you to remove an additional cards over that one default card that is required. So if you’ve used 2 or 3 additional cards, the app will not allow you to remove them. The app claims it cannot remove them due to “signal issues” but yet the app still manages to request rides and updates your location just fine with those same “signal issues.”\n\nPretty crummy that want to hold customers financial information like that. I recommend sticking with Uber and Lyft. Trusted, tried and true. The little guys like Via are not worth it all. Much more trouble than they’re worth.

While in line (at the Burger King) we noticed we were behind a vehicle with the branding of the hit popular ride share app “via”. The van itself looked amazing. Simple yet elegant. The only thing that really ticked us off was they WOULD NOT turn off their back window wiper!!! It very much annoyed us due to the back window already being clean!

The problem is they completely snd utterly changed the usage of the app. EVERY SINGLE TIME I use it now it always says 3 minute car available but takes several minutes to book so that they can then say “driver had to cancel but don’t worry a new one is ____ minutes away!” Now the really annoying part is that the minutes are straight up lies. Today I waited 40 minutes for a via that was originally “6” minutes away!! This is the longest this has ever happened to me but definite not the first (this currently happens every single time to varying degrees). I finally contacted customer support who told me the driver have been disconnected from the app so they would send me a new one... WHY DIDNT THEY TELL ME THAT BEFORE?!!! I’m just so frustrated with the horrendous quality of the app right now but I have hope for it going back to normal after covid!",

So you would think that Via would follow suit to protect their customers, right? Wrong. The wait times are 20+ minutes which I can tolerate, there is a short walk to the pickup location which I can tolerate, the rides are cheap which I love BUT riding in the car with several strangers in the mist of a pandemic?? THATS SO IRRESPONSIBLE! I rather pay $10 more on another app to know that I’m not increasing my chance of catching COVID. Via has officially lost a rider.",

It is inconsistent, annoying, and it has made me late countless times. \n\nMy advice, if you want to use this app, call your ride 30 minutes plus how long it takes to drive there from when you need to get there. That seems to be the balance. If you don’t want to ever be late, add 10 minutes to that. \n\nThe customer service? From what I’ve seen when I rated this, the top 5 ratings were 4 ones and 1 two. All of them with service issues, and not ONE reply or any feedback. None of them has had updates or edits telling what happened. Some of these ratings happened 1 YEAR AGO.\n\nOverall, good idea, good drivers, horrible customer service, inconsistent and bad app. There are much better options.",

Prevent Ride Steals!\n\nEither someone stole my ride, or the driver just inexplicably decided to mark me as picked up even though he hadn't -- but either way, I got a notification literally steps away from rounding the corner where I was scheduled to meet my Via ride, when I got the \"enjoy your ride!\" Notification.  \nI was unable to cancel the trip (no option given in the app, and I looked!) as I stood in the pouring rain, watching my cab (via the app) move north without me, nor could I book another (as the app already thought I was in a ride). \n\nBefore this happened, I loved this app and told everyone about it. It's often cheaper than both Uber(well, pre-drama) and Lyft and pretty comfy and quick. Add the cancel feature in (or a way to request refunds or make other complaints, like Uber has) and I'll up it to at least 4 stars (5 if match Uber's level for the trip options)",

      "title": "Don’t sign any contracts!",
      "text": "I signed a contract with Silver Scripts which is a government program for Seniors! After I heard about how they allow men in the showers with young women ( a photo was in social media showing a 12 year old girl sitting on a bench in the women’s dressing room with only a towel rapped around her) while a man and trust me you can tell it’s a male is standing next to her!! A woman asked him to leave the dressing room and he refused because he said I now identify as a woman! And so she took the photo and went to the manager and asked them to please remove the man because there is a child in a towel!! They told the woman she was out of line and she was thrown out and her membership canceled! So when I saw the photo and heard about the situation as a former teacher and having a degree in Childhood development my first inclination is of course always to protect children-ALWAYS!! So my husband and I only pay extra for the “ black area since silver script pays for our gym membership!! \n   So next my husband called our bank to cancel our Black card membership and I called silver script to make sure they wouldn’t continue to pay and they informed me I didn’t even need to let them know or the gym because if we don’t attend they don’t pay the gym!! \n  So we thought we did our due diligence!! Next thing I know my husband says he looks at one of his credit cards and Planet Fitness is taking payments from his credit card! So I call and I am very upset!! So come to find out when the guy , Jon,  finally told me not only did the have our bank account we gave them to pay the “Black area “they  somehow got another of my credit cards? I was livid because they got that card when I purchased something at the gym. \n   So to sum it all up. I went down to the gym because now according to the manager , “ Jess\nAka Jessica , we should have been told to come in person to cancel the membership ( although that still isn’t always 100% but be careful because they are shady!) they can do it over the phone it just depends on who you talk to and when. But Jess wanted to make a point and she was arguing with me there was no original but I remember signing a piece of paper and what they handed me certainly was not what I had originally signed and in fact you can’t even read the silver script government ID numbers because when they cut and pasted they covered over it!   \n    I asked for my original contract I signed and they told me no such thing! Everything is inside their computer. So here’s what they handed me and this is why you should never use your debit, credit or even sign up for planet fitness: they handed me a contract  with two bank accounts, a debit card, my government account-“  silver script number and finally a final credit card. So in total they had four different credit accounts to draw from. And they had written down three different dates with my signatures. Now if I was going to give them my credit I would do it all at the same time!!! And what was even worse they put\n “ staff  Initial “ just the word no persons initial !!! Because no real person saw me write it or witnessed it!! \n    My son in law actually does contracts for Banks and corporations. I’m going to be sending him the contract they gave me. You can even tell on the first page it looks like it was cut and pasted! \n    So you know how you hear there’s no such thing as a free lunch!! When they say it’s only $10 a month DON’T  GO  THERE!! DON’T SIGN ANYTHING!! DON ‘T TAKE YOU’RE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY DON’T care as ABOUT CHILDREN EITHER! DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS THEY SAY ITS FREE FOR CHILDREN BUT LOOK AT WHO ELSE SHOWS UP AND HANGS OUT IN THE DRESSING ROOMS!!! \n   So protect yourselves and your children!! \nRESEARCH GYMS. IF YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA BUT THEY ARE HONEST THEN ITS WORTH IT! Don’t ever use your cards there because they somehow got access to two bank accounts a debit and a credit card and they had access to my government account!!",

      "text": "I have been using the PF located on Telshore in Las Cruces, NM 5 days a week for the past 7 months. In general, I  have been satisfied with the service overall . However, lately I have noticed a decline in the upkeep of the facility. Lately, a number of pieces of equipment (at least 7) have gone months without being repaired. I find it hard to understand why spare replacement parts aren’t stocked. Additionally, at least 4 of the TV monitors have been frozen for the past 4 weeks. Two weeks ago I asked the manager specifically about tv monitor #4, since it’s set on CNN, which I like to watch and listen to with my earphones while on the treadmill. He stated that he would look into it but 2 weeks later, the streaming link is still broken. I don’t understand why a different working  tv monitor can’t be tuned in to CNN while the connection problem is investigated and fixed. I hope someone will look into the issues in the Telshore location and take action to resolve them. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.",

Yeah! you're an *sshole, you called me and all my coworkers racist, you're an *sshole!\" Ben proceeded  the front desk counter and having to be physically restrained by a female employee who was clearly restraining him with her own physical body to prevent further escalation from planet fitness's employee at prescott, az, BEN. BEN continued to not follow his employee conduct that he agreed to when working on the clock as a planet fitness employee, in uniform, without his name tag on. How convenient for ben huh? He decides hes gonna swear at me, double down on his lies about something i never had said and take even further by annoucing it to all his co workers anf members passing by. Not only sharing, but lying about it all in the process, slandering my reputation and my conduct with his false public statements. Thankfully not the manager but another employee seen what BEN was doing  and actually follows their guidelines which i think goes without saying is never to use profanity and conduct yourself in a threatening, egregious, abhorrent   manner the way BEN was doing on 9/10 , from moment i scanned in 11:15 til when I left after my business was done with my workout. The GM at this location, Randy will permit and allow employees like BEN, to break protocol when he sees it suffice. Rules are black and white, not grey. This Planet fitness management will state to you its against their policies to record anything they say because they do not want anything as far as employement termination coming back to them. They will state they do not see such evidence in their camera recordings and will disregard any evidence that is plain and clear to see to cover their own security over actually following their employee conduct handbook and standing up for their members against disrespectful employees like BEN. BEN was permitted to swear at me , call me *sshole multiple times, get so unprofessional that other co workers step in between himself and the pathway towards me to prevent him from getting physical altercation with me. If you tell them how to improve their gym in confidential member survey, this location in particular will allow employees like Ben to swear at members, misquote them in a slandering , threatening way for all to hear in the gym,  and for managers like Randy to permit it and vouch for their employees disrespecful, egregious, threatening, conduct towards members they feel like discriminating against like myself not just cause or reason.",

      "text": "There has been the problem with some of the PF locations not offering training classes due to the staff failing to hire trainers although they advertise that they offer them for members which is included as part of their membership. However members are aware that they are paying for this service out of their monthly fees and/or from the annual fees they’re being charged for at the location where they signed up. Apparently, it has been weeks, if not months with no available fitness coaches throughout the  LA locations. Who do we report this to? Perhaps the district managers? It just seems that they are not seeking or hiring them out of due diligence and rather letting this part of the job slip. Also their app lets you schedule the appointment times with the opening slots even though there are no trainers available for those times at all. Goodness, that is misleading. The staff are aware of this issue yet they don’t seem to take this up to the corporate. If they did the it should’ve been somewhat fixed by now. However if you don’t have coaches at your locations, let the members be aware of it by posting signs at the gym so they know the current update. We’d love to see those classes to become available with what they’re claiming on the PF website!",

The app offers a lot of excellent ideas for low impact strength training that I have been researching from home and attempting to perform at the gym, and I’m starting to get my confidence back. \n\nI highly recommend Planet fitness, even if I only spend a half hour to an hour in the gym at this point, it is a step in the right direction. My energy level and confidence is already increasing after a week, give this place a shot if you I’ve been thinking about starting to take action to live a healthier lifestyle.",

I think there should be a filter for yoga/pilates and you should be able to save it as a favorite so you can go back to it. I shouldn’t have to search through everything all over to try and find it. I don’t know if any of the locations actually have classes you can join for yoga or Pilates, but my location does not, so the app video is the only method I have available for this particular class. Please include this option on the app to save favorites and a separate filter for yoga and Pilates. This app so far is average, but it could be much better.",

      "text": "You can’t cancel via the app.  I had to go in. \n\nNow, this isn’t against the app but it is against PF. I signed in June and paid the sign up fee plus $15 monthly fee. My youngest gets the student summer pass but needed me to take her. Unfortunately, with work and band camp we couldn’t get there. She was free. I wasn’t. I noticed that I had another $49 fee about a month after I signed up. This is an annual fee. Maybe I didn’t read the fine print, but why would I be charged another $49 less than two months after joining? IMHO the sign up should include the year fee. I feel I just wasted $145 for I won’t be refunded the annual fee. So, I believe sign up should include all fees and yearly fees be charged one year after joining. There shouldn’t be a blanket charge each July/August. Had I joined in September I wouldn’t have had this annual fee until the next summer. I’d have canceled by then. Something for the company to think about…",

      "text": "I strongly advise against choosing this health club chain. They have extremely underhanded business practices and very poorly kept facilities. I had so many, many issues with them in the clubs that I went to in the few years that I did use them.  And I had used three different clubs in the area since I do local traveling.  It wasn’t just an issue with one bad club; they are all like this.  All three had issues.  \n\nThe list is long - freezing cold men’s locker room in one, nonworking showers in all of them regularly, people leaving weights everywhere and not cleaning up after themselves because no one makes them, tvs not working, cardio equipment not working, one played Spanish music all the time (literal Spanish singing, like we were south of the border), another played LOUD ghetto rap all the time, inadequate amount of equipment for the amount of members (regularly had to wait for equipment, dragging your workout much longer than it should be), VERY limited range of equipment (none have a bench press machine, nor a squat rack!), and that’s just the stuff off the top of my head.\n\nAfter I moved, there was no planet fitness near me.  Plus, my college had a MUCH better gym that I could use for free. I had no locked in commitment to them, just a monthly agreement that I could cancel at anytime.  But, as soon as I did try to cancel, they had a ton of hoops for me to jump through. They required me to go to the original gym. I signed up at. That gym was now hours away from me, so that was completely unfeasible. the other gyms refused to let me cancel, though, and used the excuse that I had to go to that one, like they didn’t all have me in the system!  Just a scam to try to get you stuck with them by giving you a huge inconvenience if you move.\n\nThe other option was to send a written letter requesting to cancel. I did this, and with tracking no less to confirm they got it.  They STILL claimed they never got my letter, even though I had confirmation from the tracking that they did!!!\n\nThese illegitimate and literally illegal excuses to try to keep you locked into a non-binding contract. Even though I haven’t used their facility in nearly a year now, they still try to act like I’m supposed to be paying them monthly!!! Fortunately, no collections agencies will accept their debts, because they all know they are illegitimate and can’t actually collect on them legally.\n\nAnyway, it’s not worth saving the money. There are multiple other options you can use where yes, you will pay a little bit more, but you will have much better equipment, a much better kept facility, and if you move or have something else come up where you need to cancel, they aren’t going do something as underhanded as this company does try to keep you locked into something that you were never locked into to begin with. Look around the Internet, everyone else has the same exact issues. They are reputation is absolutely horrible because of it. I strongly, strongly advise you go somewhere else, or if you have already signed up and that’s why you have the app, I suggest you go to the gym you signed up at and cancel immediately while you still can.",

So I ended up closing the bank account I used to pay them. Then I got badgered for like 3 months that my billing info need updated, yada yada, hadn’t been there in over 500 days. Well, somehow they got the information of a card I activated like a week ago through an entirely different bank and charged me for past and current months. I call them and ask how they got this number and some stoner kid was on there saying they require two forms of payment at sign up, so that must be how they got it. I was like how did you get a card that I just activated last week, 5 years ago when I opened the account? “Uhhhhhhhhh here call abc PFHealth,” didn’t even know the number just like I was supposed to know who that is. All right gym but there customer service and billing is a nightmare and a half. Not worth it.",

      "text": "I joined Planet Fitness when my daughter’s father joined so we could go as a family, he could help with our daughter etc. Unfortunately, I became paralyzed due to a serious staph infection inside my spine that spread to my bloodstream, bone, heart & brain.  Needless to say, I was hospitalized for months prior to being transferred to a rehabilitation facility learning how to sit, stand, walk, take care of my daughter, etc.  I had called the club asking about canceling my membership, but was told I had to come inside the club to do so.  I explained that I was not only paralyzed, but I’m hospitalized & have no idea when I’ll be discharged, let alone be released ny doctos to go to the club.  Informed them they can easily check and see that I’ve never once been able to go to the facility.  Eventually I was discharged from the rehabilitation center & learned how to walk with the assistance of a cane and went to planet fitness to cancel my membership, however I wasn’t able to do so since it was during the midnight shift and needed to come back during the day.  I’ve been in and out of the hospital ever since due to a weakened immune system, haven’t been able to return since.  Meanwhile Planet Fitness has definitely made sure to withdraw the $25.05 every single month for almost 2 years now. They make it so easy to join to their gym online without any issues, but it’s absolutely impossible to cancel without going in personally! Just something to think about, nobody plans on traumatic injuries or accidents happening causing the inability to drive, walk or be hospitalized for months, but Planet Fitness definitely takes advantage of people when those situations happen, and I’m still to this day having to pay for a membership that I’m not able to take advantage due to health problems and this has been ongoing for 2 entire years now!!!  Just something to consider if you plan on joining their facility online. I used to be personal trainer and as a music Dj created Zumba tracks for several fitness centers across the country prior to health issues. Thankfully I still remain in contact with about 90% of my clients so I’ve definitely been able to share my experience & problems with Planet Fitness. I may only have about 10,000 followers, but I’m sure it’s probably made some type of impact on their new memberships in the Chicagoland area.",

Following this an employee in the store asked me to leave and said I wasn’t allowed in the gym. I showed him the transaction history that shows that I paid for my membership and was still exited from the building. I had to resolve the issue on my own, without the help of customer service or support from PF representatives before my membership was reinstated, but now have no intention of continuing any fitness regimen I previously had in place or was planning on implementing with them in the future because of this harrowing experience.

I was there the other day with two bars and it was pretty busy. I had to wait to use some equipment, and at that point I checked again and it had 3 bars. It never filled in more bars than that though. So by this logic 4 bars should be maxed out; or 5 bars MAYBE if there are like, lines to use everything! Why would it go up to TEN BARS and make us think it isn’t busy! The fact that PF tries to make it LOOK like it isn’t very busy renders the whole thing useless and deceptive. \n\nI thought it was a neat feature that I’d use a lot when I signed up, but now I see it’s only a marketing ploy and PF is a lot busier than anyone would ever want. You should be truthful about it and 3 bars should really be around 7. Or change it to 5 bars being the max. Either way, the way it’s set up now with 10 bars and only having it at 2-3 all week long is misleading and pointless.",

      "text": "Following an embarrassingly unpleasant experience at Planet Fitness, Aramingo Avenue, Philadelphia, I strongly advise against visiting or joining this gym. \nI visited Planet Fitness in my quest for a well equipped, accessible gym in the area and after finding it a suitable place decided to join it. But minutes later the manager attitude left no room for me to come back to the gym again. \nAfter making my mind to join the gym, I took permission from the staff on the front desk for a short video of the place. I thought I will encourage my acquaintance as well to join and show them how well equipped it was. As soon as I started making video with my mobile, a visibly angry woman appeared ordering me to stop filming. I turned off the camera and explained that I did it with permission from the front desk. She, however, said that she is the manager and asked me if I would stop the video or would prefer to be expelled. I told her that I already turned off the camera and that I expect her to say the same thing gently but she grew angrier asking me how did I enter the gym. Since she was making me feel very awkward, I came back to the front desk staff to explain that I was using camera after getting her permission but that lady there was behaving very rough. While I said this, the manager arrived and angrily asked me why I was speaking there again. To avoid the increasingly embarrassing situation, I left the gym feeling more like I had an encounter with a gangster rather than a gym manager. \nMy sincere advice for new gym aspirants is don’t visit or join this gym if you don’t want to be treated by unprofessional and arrogant staff. Every person deserves respect.",

People want to go someone where they feel wanted , not somewhere where they feel like they aren’t welcome and told your back again , like what does it matter if someone comes back when their a member and haven’t done anything wrong. I could understand if I damaged something or did something but none of that have I done at workout anytime I have felt more welcome at Planet fitness then workout anytime. All I had to do yesterday was call planet fitness and the guy up front told me I was welcome to come with my daughter. The only suggestion I have for planet  fitness is on the app putting a place for pictures to be took inside the app. To keep track of your progress. Other then that I have enjoyed it at planet fitness and was thankful to the staff who aloud me to be a guest before I joined!",

Great Hydro beds and massage chairs obviously my favorite thing the gym offers the massage bed. Clean bathroom,  customer service is average, staff not too friendly definitely not outgoing to my standard but not rude or non responsive either. One employee an overnight employee definitely brings customer service down to a near bad review and was nearly tempted to put the place on a a negative social media blast as I felt, I was being targeted as someone by an employee who does not like me and I felt as if he did not appreciate my service as as a customer , and his customer service was very poor, and I felt like he was agitated by me every time I was around and wanted something like a drink or lay in the tanning bed or whatever.

I was told that many Optum members are experiencing the same issue. I have complained twice within the app but it hasn’t seemed to be very effective. If this app check in worked for me, I would give it a higher rating.\n\nUPDATE: I received a response from the developer 2 months later and my concern was not addressed in the response. I never mentioned the Apple Watch check in and that’s what their response was about. Duh!\n\nMeanwhile, the check in feature on my iPhone is now working.

      "text": "I recently used the Porter app to send a truck for delivery in Dubai. While the service itself was convenient, the payment experience was frustrating. I paid the driver 150 AED in cash as agreed, but later, the app kept asking me for a separate payment through the app. Despite providing proof of payment to the driver, the support team kept insisting on additional payment.\n\nThis kind of confusion and lack of communication between the app and its drivers is disappointing. Until they improve their payment system and customer support, I’d recommend being cautious when using this service.",

      "text": "Was assigned a partner, gave a deposit only to be told day before move that it’s a holiday so the booking can’t go through. I scrambled to make the move that same day and was assigned a Porter with an open truck on a rain day. I asked to cancel the whole thing and was instead randomly assigned a third partner who is a no show. I’m appalled at the lack of disclosure (open trucks) and inability to Porter to keep their end of the bargain. The porters seem a law unto themselves, the third one went silent after calling to fix up a time with me.",

Whats the point of having an app when you are running a call centre like service. And how come you are getting the information about what activity I am doing on app. Its so inconvenient and unsafe.

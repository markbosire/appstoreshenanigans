  "description": "Edmonton On Demand Transit service is available 7 days a week to connect select areas of the city that don’t have a regular bus route to Edmonton’s transit network. This service is operated on behalf of the City of Edmonton by PWTransit Canada in partnership with Via Transportation.\n\nWhat does on-demand mean?\nIt means you can get a ride when you need it. No more bus schedules and shorter wait times.\n\nHow does Edmonton On Demand Transit work?\nYou can book a ride on an accessible shuttle bus by using this app on a smartphone, visiting the website edmonton.ca/OnDemandTransit or calling 780-496-2400.\n\nHow do I get started?\nStart by downloading the Edmonton On Demand Transit app, then create an easy account using only your name, phone number and email address. Confirm your location and input your destination to see the ride options. Then, book your ride and track it in real time. If you are calling in, provide the same information to the representative who will give you step by step instructions.  \n\nWho is driving the buses?\nProfessionally-trained drivers from PWTransit will operate the On Demand Transit shuttle buses.\n\nHow long will I wait?\nIt depends on your trip and the time of day – but wait times will be less than 30 minutes in peak times and 60 minutes in off peak times. An accurate estimate of your wait time will be provided before you book your trip. You will be able to track the vehicle location in real-time using the Edmonton On Demand Transit app.\n\nWhat else is helpful to know?\nIf you use a wheelchair or other mobility device, have a child stroller or need access to a built-in child safety seat, it’s important to put that in your Edmonton On Demand Transit booking or mention that to the phone representative. That way, we can ensure a spot is available for you.\n\nWhy are you offering this new service?\nTo provide connection to the regular Edmonton transit network from areas where flexible On Demand Transit is a better fit than big bus service.",
